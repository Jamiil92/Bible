In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.,"Sanam mɛ Gusunɔ u handunia torua, u wɔllu ka tem taka kua."
And the earth was waste and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep: and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.,"Tem daa wãawa bitam. Gãanu kun wãa mɛ sɔɔ. Mɛn temɔ wɔru bɔkɔwa ga wãa mi, ma yam wɔ̃kura gu wukiri. Ma nim mu tɛrie tem mɛn wɔllu gia. Nim mɛn wɔllɔwa Gusunɔn Hunde ra n bɛllimɔ."
"And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.","Yera Gusunɔ u nɛɛ, yam bururam mu kooro. Ye u gerua mɛ, ma mu koora."
"And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.","Ma yam bururam mɛ, mu nùn wɛ̃re. Saa yera u mu wunana ka yam wɔ̃kuru."
"And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, one day.","Ma u yam bururam soka sɔ̃ɔ sɔɔ, yam wɔ̃kuru maa wɔ̃kuru. Ma sɔ̃ɔ sɔɔ ge ka wɔ̃ku te, n swĩina ma n kua tɔ̃ɔ gbiikiru."
"And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.","Ma Gusunɔ u nɛɛ, gãanu nu tɛrio wɔllɔ nge gɔna kpa mu n nim bɔnu sãa."
"And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.","Ye u gerua mɛ, ma wom mu tɛria mu nim mɛ bɔnu kua. Sukum wãa nim wɔllɔ, sukum maa wãa temɔ."
"And God called the firmament Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, a second day.","Ma u gãa ni soka wɔllu. Saa ye u yeba mɔ̀, sɔ̃ɔ sɔɔ ka wɔ̃kuru n swĩina ma n kua tɔ̃ru yiruse."
"And God said, Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.","Ma Gusunɔ u nɛɛ, nim mɛ mu wãa wom dirum temɔ mu subenu koowo kpa tem gbebum mu tera. Ye u gerua mɛ, ma n koora."
And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.,"Ma u tem gbebum mɛ soka tem, ma u maa nim sube nin baatere soka nim wɔ̃ku. Ma n nùn wɛ̃re."
"And God said, Let the earth put forth grass, herbs yielding seed, and fruit-trees bearing fruit after their kind, wherein is the seed thereof, upon the earth: and it was so.","Yera u nɛɛ, tem mu gãa dabinu kpiiyo, ka yaka si su ko n binu marumɔ ka dãa binugii bwese bweseka ni nu nin bweseru mɔ nin marum sɔɔ. Ye u gerua mɛ, ma n koora."
"And the earth brought forth grass, herbs yielding seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit, wherein is the seed thereof, after their kind: and God saw that it was good.","Tem mu gãa dabinu kpia, ka yaka bwese bweseka si su binu marumɔ, ka dãa binugii bwese bweseka ni nu bweseru mɔ nin marum sɔɔ. Ma n nùn wɛ̃re."
"And there was evening and there was morning, a third day.","Ye u yeba mɔ̀, sɔ̃ɔ sɔɔ ka wɔ̃kuru n swĩina ma n kua tɔ̃ru itase."
"And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years:","Ma Gusunɔ u nɛɛ, fitilanu nu kooro wom dirum sɔɔ kpa nu sɔ̃ɔ sɔɔ ka wɔ̃kuru wunana, kpa nu n sɔ̃ɔsimɔ saa ye wɔ̃su ka tɔ̃ɔ bakanu koo tore."
and let them be for lights in the firmament of heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.,"Kpa nu n sãa fitilanu wom dirum sɔɔ nu ka tem yam bururasia. Ye u gerua mɛ, ma n koora."
"And God made the two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.","U fitila bakanu yiru kua, niya sɔ̃ɔ ka suru. U maa kperi kua. U sɔ̃ɔ kuawa u n ka bandu dii sɔ̃ɔ sɔɔ, ma u suru kua u n ka bandu dii wɔ̃kuru."
"And God set them in the firmament of heaven to give light upon the earth,","Ma u ni kpuro doke wɔllɔ nu n ka tem yam bururasie,"
"and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.","kpa nu n sãa sɔ̃ɔ sɔɔ ka wɔ̃kurun sunɔ, kpa nu n yam bururam ka yam wɔ̃kuru wunanɛ. Ma n nùn wɛ̃re."
"And there was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.","Saa ye u yeba mɔ̀, sɔ̃ɔ sɔɔ ka wɔ̃kuru n swĩina ma n kua tɔ̃ru nnɛse."
"And God said, Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.","Ma Gusunɔ u nɛɛ, nim mu de hunde koniba dabi dabinu nu koora mɛ sɔɔ, kpa gunɔsu su n yɔ̃ɔmɔ wom dirum sɔɔ."
"And God created the great sea-monsters, and every living creature that moveth, wherewith the waters swarmed, after their kind, and every winged bird after its kind: and God saw that it was good.",Yera u swɛ̃ɛ bɛkɛ taka kua ka yɛɛ kpuro yi yi sĩimɔ yi yiba nim mɛ sɔɔ bwese bweseka. U maa gunɔsu kua bwese bweseka. Ma n nùn wɛ̃re.
"And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.","Yen biru u yi domaru kua u nɛɛ, yi kɔwaro yi dabia yi yibu nim wɔ̃kun nim sɔɔ kpa gunɔsu su dabia handunia sɔɔ."
"And there was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.","Saa ye u yeba mɔ̀, sɔ̃ɔ sɔɔ ka wɔ̃kuru n swĩina ma n kua tɔ̃ru nɔɔbuse."
"And God said, Let the earth bring forth living creatures after their kind, cattle, and creeping things, and beasts of the earth after their kind: and it was so.","Ma Gusunɔ u nɛɛ, yɛɛ bwese bweseka yi maruro tem sɔɔ. Yiya kpaaku yɛɛ ka gbeeku yɛɛ ka yɛɛ yi yi ra kabiri, yi kpuro bwese bweseka. Ye u gerua mɛ, ma n koora."
"And God made the beasts of the earth after their kind, and the cattle after their kind, and everything that creepeth upon the ground after its kind: and God saw that it was good.",U gbeeku yɛɛ kua bwese bweseka ka kpaaku yɛɛ ka yɛɛ yi yi ra kabiri. Ma n nùn wɛ̃re.
"And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the heavens, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.","Yen biru Gusunɔ u nɛɛ, kon tɔnu taka ko u n sãa nɛn weenasii mam mam, kpa u n sãa ye na taka kua kpuron wirugii. Yeya tem kpuro ka swɛ̃ɛ ka gunɔsu ka kpaaku yɛɛ ka yɛɛ yi yi ra kabiri temɔ kpuro."
"And God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.","Ye u gerua mɛ, ma u tɔnu taka kua u ka nùn weenɛ mam mam. U bu kuawa durɔ ka kurɔ."
"And God blessed them: and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the heavens, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.","Ma u bu domaru kua u nɛɛ, i maruro i dabia i handunia yibu ya n sãa bɛɛgia kpa i n yɛɛ kpuro nɔma sikerenɛ. Yiya swɛ̃ɛ ka gunɔsu ka yɛɛ yi yi sĩimɔ temɔ kpuro."
"And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb yielding seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for food:","U maa nɛɛ, wee ye i ko n da di. Yeya yakɔ bweseru baatere tem sɔɔ kpuro te ta ra binu ma, ka dãa binugiru baatere te ta ten bweseru mɔ ten marum sɔɔ."
"and to every beast of the earth, and to every bird of the heavens, and to everything that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for food: and it was so.","Ma u maa handunian yɛɛ kpuro yi yi hunde mɔ yi sĩimɔ temɔ ka gunɔsu kpuro sɔ̃ɔwa u nɛɛ, na bɛɛ yakɔ beku baagere wɛ̃ i n da di. Ye u gerua mɛ, ma n koora."
"And God saw everything that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.","Yera u mɛɛra kpuro ye u kua, ma n nùn wɛ̃re gem gem. Saa ye u yeba mɔ̀, sɔ̃ɔ sɔɔ ka wɔ̃kuru n swĩina ma n kua tɔ̃ru nɔɔba tiase."
"And the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.",Nge mɛya Gusunɔ u ka wɔllu ka tem ka kpuro ye ya wãa sɔɔ taka kua u wiru go.
And on the seventh day God finished his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.,Tɔ̃ru nɔɔba tiase sɔɔra u win sɔma ye u kua kpuro wiru go ma u wɛ̃ra tɔ̃ru nɔɔba yiruse.
"And God blessed the seventh day, and hallowed it; because that in it he rested from all his work which God had created and made.","Ma u nɔɔba yiruse te yi nɛnɛm win sɔ̃, u tu domaru kua yèn sɔ̃ te sɔɔra u wɛ̃ra ye u kpuro taka kua u kpa."
"These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that Jehovah God made earth and heaven.","Sanam mɛ Yinni Gusunɔ u wɔllu ka tem taka kua,"
"And no plant of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprung up; for Jehovah God had not caused it to rain upon the earth: and there was not a man to till the ground;","dãru gara kun gina kpia tem sɔɔ, yakasu gasu kun maa kpia domi Yinni Gusunɔ kun gina gura nɛɛsie sanam mɛ. Tɔnu maa sari wi u koo tem mɛ wuku."
"but there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.",Adama kakoru garu ta ra se tem di tu tem mɛ nikererasia kpuro.
"And Jehovah God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.","Yen biruwa Yinni Gusunɔ u tɔnu mɔma ka tem u nùn wãarun wom wɛ̃sie win wɛ̃rɔ, ma tɔnu kua waso."
"And Jehovah God planted a garden eastward, in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.","Ma Yinni Gusunɔ u gbaaru kua Edɛniɔ sɔ̃ɔ yari yerun bera, ma u tɔnu wi u kua mi sua u doke sɔɔ."
"And out of the ground made Jehovah God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.","Ma u dãa bwese bweseka kpiisia te sɔɔ, ni nu waabu wã ka ni nu dim do, ka sere dãa tèn binu nu koo tɔnu wãaru wɛ̃, ka maa tèn binu nu koo tɔnu gea ka kɔ̃sa giasia. Dãnu yiru ye, nu wãawa gbaa ten suunu sɔɔ."
"And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became four heads.","Daaru gara wãa gbaa te sɔɔ, te ta tu nike nikeru sãa. Min diya ta yara ma ta kɛri kua nnɛ."
"The name of the first is Pishon: that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;",Gbiikaan yĩsira Pisoni. Yeya ya tem mɛ ba mɔ̀ Hafila sikerenɛ.
and the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.,"Tem mɛ sɔɔra wura gea wãa. Turare nubu durorugia maa wãa mi, ka kpee gobiginu."
And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Cush.,Kɛra yirusen yĩsira maa Gihoni. Yeya ya tem mɛ ba mɔ̀ Kusi sikerenɛ.
And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth in front of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.,Kɛra itasewa maa Tigiri. Yeya ya kokumɔ tem mɛ ba mɔ̀ Asirin sɔ̃ɔ yari yeru gia. Kɛra nnɛsewa maa Efarati.
"And Jehovah God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.","Ye Yinni Gusunɔ u gbaa te sɔɔru kua u kpa Edɛniɔ, yera u tɔnu wi sua u doke sɔɔ u ka tu wuku kpa u n tu kɔ̃su."
"And Jehovah God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:","Ma u nùn wooda yeni wɛ̃ u nɛɛ, kaa kpĩ a gbaa ten dãnu kpuron binu di."
"but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.","Adama dãa tèn binu nu koo tɔnu gea ka kɔ̃sa giasia, a ku ra ten binu di, domi dɔma te a nu di, kaa gbiwa."
"And Jehovah God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a help meet for him.",Interlude
"And out of the ground Jehovah God formed every beast of the field, and every bird of the heavens; and brought them unto the man to see what he would call them: and whatsoever the man called every living creature, that was the name thereof.","Ka tema Yinni Gusunɔ u gbeeku yɛɛ kpuro kua ka gunɔsu kpuro, ma u ka ye kpuro na tɔnu win mi, u ka wa mɛ u koo ye yĩsiru kɛ̃. Ma tɔnu wi, u yaa sabenu kpuro ka gunɔsu ka gbeeku yɛɛ kpuro yĩsa kã. Yĩsi te tɔnu wi, u maa yaa baayere kã teya ba ka ye sokumɔ. Adama ye kpuro sɔɔ, sari ye ya ka nùn weenɛ ye ya koo nùn somi. Yen sɔ̃na Yinni Gusunɔ u nɛɛ, n ǹ wã tɔnu u n wãa wi turo. Kon nùn goo kua u n sãa nge wi, wi u koo nùn somi."
"And the man gave names to all cattle, and to the birds of the heavens, and to every beast of the field; but for man there was not found a help meet for him.",Yera Yinni Gusunɔ u tɔnu wi dom mɔn bakaru kpɛ̃ɛ u dweeya. Ma u win yɛ̃san kuku teeru wuna ma u yɛ̃sa ye kɔrua ka yaa baasi.
"And Jehovah God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept; and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof:","Ma u tɔn kurɔ taka kua ka tɔn durɔn kuku te, te u wuna. Ma u ka nùn na tɔn durɔ win mi."
"and the rib, which Jehovah God had taken from the man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.","Yera durɔ wi, u nɛɛ, wee tɛ̃, wini u wasi mɔ nge nɛgii mam mam. Ba koo nùn sokuwa tɔn kurɔ, domi tɔn durɔn min diya u yara."
"And the man said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.","Yen sɔ̃na durɔ u koo win tundo ka win mɛro deri kpa wi ka win kurɔ ba n maninɛ, kpa be yiru kpuro bu ko wasi tee."
"Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.","Saa ye sɔɔ, durɔ wi ka win kurɔ terera ba wãa. Sekura kun maa ben goo mɔ̀."
"And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.","N deema waa ya bwisi bo gbeeku yɛɛ kpuro sɔɔ yi Yinni Gusunɔ u taka kua. Yera ya na kurɔ win mi, ya nùn bikia ya nɛɛ, ka gem Gusunɔ u nɛɛ, i ku gbaa tenin dãa binu kpuro di?"
"Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which Jehovah God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of any tree of the garden?","Ma kurɔ wi, u ye wisa u nɛɛ, sa ra gbaa ten dãa binu di ni,"
"And the woman said unto the serpent, Of the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat:","ma n kun mɔ te ta wãa suunu sɔɔ. Tera u nɛɛ, su ku mam ten binu baba su sere di su ku ka gbin sɔ̃."
"but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.","Yera waa ye, ya kurɔ wi wisa ya nɛɛ, i ǹ gbimɔ pai!"
"And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:","Domi Gusunɔ u yɛ̃ dɔma te i ten binu di, bɛɛn nɔni koo wukiarawa kpa i n sãa nge win tii, i n gea ka kɔ̃sa yɛ̃."
"for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as God, knowing good and evil.","Ma kurɔ wi, u wa dãa te, ta ka dii dobu weenɛ ta waabu wã, ta koo maa kpĩ tu nùn ko bwisigii. Ma u ten bii ni sɔra u di. U maa win durɔ wɛ̃ ka wi ba wãasinɛ, ma wi, u maa di."
"And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat; and she gave also unto her husband with her, and he did eat.",Yera be yiru kpuron nɔni wukiara ba gia ma terera ba wãa. Ma ba da ba dãa te ba mɔ̀ figien wuru bakasu bura ba swɛɛna ba ka tii gandi.
"And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig-leaves together, and made themselves aprons.","Ye ba Yinni Gusunɔn nɔɔ nua u bɔsu gbaa te sɔɔ yoka, yera ba da ba nùn kukue gbaa ten dãnun suunu sɔɔ."
And they heard the voice of Jehovah God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of Jehovah God amongst the trees of the garden.,"Adama Yinni Gusunɔ u durɔ wi soka u nɛɛ, mana a wãa."
"And Jehovah God called unto the man, and said unto him, Where art thou?","Durɔ wi, u wisa u nɛɛ, ye na wunɛn nɔɔ nua gbaaru sɔɔ, bɛrum man mwa domi terera na wãa, ma na kukua."
"And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.","Gusunɔ u nɛɛ, wara nun sɔ̃ɔwa ma terera a wãa. Nge a dãa ten binu diwa te na nɛɛ, a ku di."
"And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?","Durɔ wi, u nɛɛ, kurɔ wi a man wɛ̃ u n ka man wãa wiya man dãa ten binu wɛ̃ ma na di."
"And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.","Ma Yinni Gusunɔ u kurɔ wi bikia u nɛɛ, mban sɔ̃na a kua mɛ. Ma u wisa u nɛɛ, waa ya man kɔkura na ka di."
"And Jehovah God said unto the woman, What is this thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.","Yinni Gusunɔ u waa ye sɔ̃ɔwa u nɛɛ, yèn sɔ̃ a kua mɛ, a kua bɔ̃rura n yɛɛ kpuro kere. Wunɛn nukura kaa n da ka kabiri. Tema kaa n da di sere ka wunɛn wãarun nɔrɔ."
"And Jehovah God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, cursed art thou above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:","Na kon maa yibɛrɛ tɛɛru doke wunɛ ka kurɔ win baa sɔɔ, ka maa wunɛn bweseru ka win bweserun baa sɔɔ. Win bweserun goo u koo nun wiru kɔra, kaa maa win naa tokuru mɛɛra ko."
"and I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed: he shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.","Yera u maa kurɔ wi sɔ̃ɔwa u nɛɛ, kon wunɛn guran wahala sosi. Kaa n da mawa ka nɔni swãaru. Wunɛn kĩru kpuro ta ko n wãawa wunɛn durɔ sɔɔ, wiya ko n maa sãa wunɛn wirugii."
"Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy pain and thy conception; in pain thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.",Interlude
"And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in toil shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;","U maa durɔ wi sɔ̃ɔwa u nɛɛ, yèn sɔ̃ a wunɛn kurɔn gari wura, ma a dãa ten binu di te na nɛɛ, a ku di, na tem bɔ̃rusi wunɛn sɔ̃.

Kaa maa wura a ko tem mɛ."
thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;,"Ma Adamu u win kurɔ yĩsiru kã Efa, domi wiya u sãa tɔmbu kpuron mɛro."
"in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.",Ma Yinni Gusunɔ u Adamu ka win kurɔ yaa gɔnan yabenu kua u bu sebusia.
And the man called his wife’s name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.,"Ma Yinni Gusunɔ u nɛɛ, wee tɔnu wi, u kua nge mɛ na sãa, u gea ka kɔ̃sa gia. Tɛ̃ na ǹ kon de u dãa bii ni nu koo nùn wãaru wɛ̃ sɔri u di u n ka wãa ka baadommaɔ."
"And Jehovah God made for Adam and for his wife coats of skins, and clothed them.",Yera u nùn gira Edɛnin gbaa ten min di u da u tem wuku mɛ u ka nùn mɔma.
"And Jehovah God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil; and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever—","Nge mɛya u ka Adamu gira ma u wɔllun kɔ̃sobu doke Edɛnin gbaa ten kɔnnɔwɔ, ge ga wãa sɔ̃ɔ yari yerun bera gia. Ba takobi nɛni ba ye fĩamɔ ma ya ballimɔ sɔ̃ɔ sɔɔ nge dɔ̃ɔ yara, ba ka dãa tèn binu nu koo tɔnu wãaru wɛ̃ kɔ̃su."
"therefore Jehovah God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.","Yen biru Adamu ka win kurɔ Efa ba mɛnna ma Efa u gura sua u Kaɛni mara. Ma u nɛɛ, ka Yinni Gusunɔn somira na tɔnu taka kua."
"So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden the Cherubim, and the flame of a sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.","Ma u maa gura sua u Abɛli, Kaɛnin wɔnɔ mara. Abɛli wiya u ra yãanu kpare, Kaɛni maa kua gbee wuko."
"And the man knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man with the help of Jehovah.","Sɔ̃ɔ mɛɛrun biru, Kaɛni u ka win kɛ̃ru na Yinni Gusunɔn mi, te ta sãa win gberun dĩanu."
"And again she bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.",Ma Abɛli maa ka wigiru na te u gɔsa saa win yaa sabenun bii gbiikinun di ni nu bɔɔru. Yinni Gusunɔ u ka Abɛli nɔni geu mɛɛra ma u win kɛ̃ru mwa.
"And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto Jehovah.","Adama u ǹ ka Kaɛni nɔnu geu mɛɛra, u ǹ maa win kɛ̃ru mwɛ. Ma Kaɛni u mɔru bara sere win wuswaa burisina."
"And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And Jehovah had respect unto Abel and to his offering:","Yera Yinni Gusunɔ u Kaɛni bikia u nɛɛ, mban sɔ̃na a mɔru bare, mban sɔ̃na wunɛn wuswaa burisinɛ."
"but unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.","Geema, à n gea mɔ̀, wunɛn bwɛ̃ra ko n kpĩ. Ǹ n maa kɔ̃san na a mɔ̀, durum ya kpĩ wunɛn dii kɔnnɔwɔ nge yaa gɔba ya nun mara. Adama a de a ye kamia."
"And Jehovah said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?","Sɔ̃ɔ teeru Kaɛni u win wɔnɔ Abɛli sɔ̃ɔwa u nɛɛ, su da gberɔ. Sanam mɛ ba wãa mi, yera u win wɔnɔ wi sɛ̃re u go."
"If thou doest well, shall it not be lifted up? and if thou doest not well, sin coucheth at the door: and unto thee shall be its desire; but do thou rule over it.","Ma Yinni Gusunɔ u da Kaɛnin mi, u nùn bikia u nɛɛ, mana wunɛn wɔnɔ Abɛli u wãa. U wisa u nɛɛ, na yɛ̃ ro? Nɛna na nɛn wɔnɔn kɔ̃so?"
"And Cain told Abel his brother. And it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.","Ma Yinni Gusunɔ u kpam nɛɛ, mba a kua mi. Wunɛn wɔnɔn yɛm mɛ mu yari temɔ, mu nɛn laakari seeye."
"And Jehovah said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: am I my brother’s keeper?",Tɛ̃ kaa ko bɔ̃ruro n kere tem mɛ a dera mu wunɛn wɔnɔ win yɛm nɔra.
"And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother’s blood crieth unto me from the ground.","À n tem mɛ wuka, mu ǹ maa nun dĩanu kuammɛ sãa sãa. Kaa n sãawa kpiko ka yaayaare kowo handunia sɔɔ."
"And now cursed art thou from the ground, which hath opened its mouth to receive thy brother’s blood from thy hand;","Yera Kaɛni u Yinni Gusunɔ sɔ̃ɔwa u nɛɛ, wee, a man sɛɛyasiamɔ bi bu man kere."
"when thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee its strength; a fugitive and a wanderer shalt thou be in the earth.","A man gire gisɔ tem mɛn di. Na dɔɔ na n kukua mi n toma wunɛn min di, kpa na n sãa kpiko na n yaayaare mɔ̀ handunia sɔɔ. Wi u man wa kpuro, kpa u man go."
"And Cain said unto Jehovah, My punishment is greater than I can bear.","Adama Yinni Gusunɔ u nùn sɔ̃ɔwa u nɛɛ, aawo, n ǹ mɛ. Goo ù n nun go, kon yɛ̃ro mɔru kɔsiawa tia tian nɔn nɔɔba yiru. Ma u Kaɛni yĩreru koosi, wi u nùn wa u ku ka nùn gon sɔ̃."
"Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the ground; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth; and it will come to pass, that whosoever findeth me will slay me.","Ma Kaɛni u doona n toma Yinni Gusunɔn min di, u da u sina Edɛnin sɔ̃ɔ yari yerun bera gia, Nɔduɔ. Yĩsi ten tubusiana yaayaaren tem."
"And Jehovah said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And Jehovah appointed a sign for Cain, lest any finding him should smite him.","Yen biru Kaɛni ka win kurɔ ba mɛnna ma kurɔ wi, u gura sua u Enɔku mara. Ma Kaɛni u wuu gagu bana u gu soka Enɔku nge win biin yĩsiru."
"And Cain went out from the presence of Jehovah, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.","Enɔku wi, u Iradi mara, Iradi maa Mɛhuyaɛli mara. Mɛhuyaɛli u Mɛtusaɛli mara ma Mɛtusaɛli u Lemɛki mara."
"And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.","Lemɛki wi, u kurɔbu yiru sua. Turon yĩsira Ada, turogira maa Sila."
And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael; and Mehujael begat Methushael; and Methushael begat Lamech.,Ada u Yabali mara. Wiya u sãa be ba wãa kunɔ ba yaa sabenu kparamɔn baaba.
