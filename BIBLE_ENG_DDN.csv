"and Josiah begat Jechoniah and his brethren, at the time of the carrying away to Babylon.",Yosiɑ mo nɑ Yekoniɑ ndɑ ɑ̀ cɛɛnɛ yom hɛi sɑɑ kɑ ǹ nɑ ǹ dii kɑ kpeindei Bɑbiloni lɑɑbu.
"And after the carrying away to Babylon, Jechoniah begat Shealtiel; and Shealtiel begat Zerubbabel;","Ǹ diiyom kɑ kpeindei Bɑbiloni lɑɑbu bɑndɑ no, Yekoniɑ mo nɑ Sɑlɑtilu hɛi. Sɑlɑtilu mo nɑ Zorobɑbe hɛi."

So all the generations from Abraham unto David are fourteen generations; and from David unto the carrying away to Babylon fourteen generations; and from the carrying away to Babylon unto the Christ fourteen generations.,"Cɛɛ kɑ cɛɛ yom di kulu zɑ Abulɛmɑ gɑɑ kɑlɑ Dɑfidi gɑɑ, ǹ kulu cɛɛ wei cindi tɑɑci no.

"Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found with child of the Holy Spirit.",Yesu Mɛsiyɑ hɛiyom zɑngɑ ɑ̀ tɛ ndɑ neyɑ.

"But when he thought on these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.","Kɑ ɑ̀ go hɛ nge yom di lɑsɑbu tɛ, cɔfɔ Kpe ŋmɔne dɔntɔneize fɔ hunutɛrɛ ɑ̀ sɛ hɑndiri kunɑ.

And she shall bring forth a son; and thou shalt call his name JESUS; for it is he that shall save his people from their sins.,À kɑɑ koo hɑibɔrɔ fɔ hɛi. Ǹ gɑ ɑ̀ mɑɑ no Yesu zɑmɑ ngɑ yɑ gɑ ngɑ jɑmɑ fɑɑbɑ ndɑ ǹ dulum yom.
"Now all this is come to pass, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying,",Hɛ wɔ kulu tɛ mo no zɑmɑ hɛ kɑ Kpe cii ɑndebi gɑɑ mɑ tɔ sɛ.
"Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, And they shall call his name Immanuel; which is, being interpreted, God with us.","Andebi di cii: “Gunɑ, hundiyo kɑ ɑ̀ si hɑru bei, ɑ̀ kɑɑ kunu.

"And Joseph arose from his sleep, and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him, and took unto him his wife;","Kɑ Yosɛfu tunu ngɑ jiibi kunɑ, ɑ̀ tɛ zɑngɑ Ikpɛ dɔntɔneize di nɑ ɑ̀ no fɔndɔ kɑ ɑ̀ mɑ ngɑ hundiyɑ hiji."
and knew her not till she had brought forth a son: and he called his name JESUS.,Ammɑ Yosɛfu si ɑ̀ bei kɑlɑ ɑ̀ nɑ koo sintine hɛi. À nɑ ɑ̀ mɑɑ dɑm Yesu.
"Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judæa in the days of Herod the king, behold, Wise-men from the east came to Jerusalem, saying,",Ǹ nɑ Yesu hɛi Bɛtɛlɛm kpɑɑrɑ Yude lɑɑbu gɑndɑkpɛ Hirodu kpetɛrɛ wɑtɛ. Cɔfɔ beirekpɛ yom hunu zɑ weenuhune kɑ kɑɑ Yerusɑlɛm wɑngɑrɑ.

"And when Herod the king heard it, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.","Ammɑ kɑ Kpe Hirodu mɑɑ ngɑ di, bɑɑru di nɑ ɑ̀ butugu, ngɑ ndɑ Yerusɑlɛm kulu."
"And gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Christ should be born.",Cɔfɔ ɑ̀ nɑ gɑrɑndikɔ jinɑ yom meigu ndɑ Moisi fɔndɑ cooɑndikɔ yom kɑ ǹ hã nungu kɑ ɑ̀ himɑ ǹ mɑ Mɛsiyɑ hɛi.
"And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judæa: for thus it is written through the prophet,","Ǹ cii ɑ̀ sɛ: Bɛtɛlɛm kpɑɑrɑ Yude lɑɑbu zɑmɑ ɑndebi nɑ wɔne hɑntum kɑ cii,"
"And thou Bethlehem, land of Judah, Art in no wise least among the princes of Judah: For out of thee shall come forth a governor, Who shall be shepherd of my people Israel.","Ni Bɛtɛlɛm, Yude lɑɑbu n mɑnɑ ci Yude kpɑɑrɑ beeri yom ŋmɔne icɛnɑ.

"And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search out exactly concerning the young child; and when ye have found him, bring me word, that I also may come and worship him.","À nɑ ǹ dɔntɔm Bɛtɛlɛm kpɑɑrɑ kɑ cii: Wɑ kpei hã ndɑ lɑɑkɑli kɑ simbɑ ndɑ koo di.

"And they, having heard the king, went their way; and lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was.","Ngei mo kɑ ǹ mɑɑ kpe di sɛ, ǹ kpei.

"And when they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.","Sɑɑ kɑ ǹ di hɑndɑriyɑizɑ cɛ, ǹ fɑihã ndɑ binekɑɑne bɑmbɑtɑ."
"And they came into the house and saw the young child with Mary his mother; and they fell down and worshipped him; and opening their treasures they offered unto him gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh.","Kɑ ǹ huro fuuɑ kunɑ, ǹ di koo di ndɑ ɑ̀ nyɑ Mɑriɑmɑ.

"Now when they were departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I tell thee: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.","Sɑɑ kɑ beirekpɛ yom di dirɑ, cɔfɔ Kpe ŋmɔne dɔntɔneize fɔ hunutɛrɛ Yosɛfu sɛ hɑndiri kunɑ.

"Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the Wise-men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the male children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the borders thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had exactly learned of the Wise-men.","Kɑ Hirodu bei beirekpɛ yom di nɑ ngɑ zɑmbɑ, ɑ̀ bine tɔ hɑli ǹ ci mɔsɔ.

"Then was fulfilled that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet, saying,","Bine, hɛ kɑ ɑndebi Yeremi cii mɑ tɔ, kɑ ɑ̀ cii:"
"A voice was heard in Ramah, Weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children; And she would not be comforted, because they are not.","“Ǹ mɑɑ jinde fɔ Lɑmɑ kpɑɑrɑ, bɛrɛɛ ndɑ hɛ̃ni ndɑ zɑlibɑ yom bɑmbɑtɑ. Lɑsɛli go hɛ̃ ngɑ koo yom sɛ. À mɑnɑ du suurɑndiyom zɑmɑ ɑ̀ koo yom bu.”"
"But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, saying,","Ammɑ kɑ Hirodu bu, cɔfɔ Kpe ŋmɔne dɔntɔneize fɔ hunutɛrɛ Yosɛfu sɛ hɑndiri kunɑ Eziputu lɑɑbu."
"Arise and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead that sought the young child’s life.","À cii: Tunu kɑ koo di ndɑ ɑ̀ nyɑ zɑɑ kɑ kpeindei Isirɑilɑ lɑɑbu zɑmɑ beerem kɑ ǹ go koo cɛnɑ di hundi ceeci, ǹ bu."

"But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judæa in the room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither; and being warned of God in a dream, he withdrew into the parts of Galilee,","Ammɑ kɑ Yosɛfu mɑɑ ǹ cii Akelu go kpetɛrɛ ŋmɑɑ Yude lɑɑbu ɑ̀ bɑɑbɑ Hirodu guribi, ɑ̀ hɑmburu ngɑ mɑ kpei nungu di.

"And in those days cometh John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judæa, saying,","Hɑnu nge yom di gɑɑ, Mirɑndikɔ Yohɑnnɑ kɑɑ ko wɑɑzu Yude lɑɑbu gɑnji kunɑ."
Repent ye; for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.,À cii: Wɑ tuubi zɑmɑ bɛɛnɛ kpetɛrɛ mɑɑni.

"and they were baptized of him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.",À nɑ ǹ mirɑndi Yudum isɑ kunɑ kɑ ǹ nɑ ngei dulum yom cii.
"But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said unto them, Ye offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?","Ammɑ ɑ̀ di Fɑrisi fɔndɔ bɔrɔ boobo ndɑ Sɑdusi fɔndɔ bɔrɔ yom go kɑɑ ngɑ mirɑndiyomɑ dɔ.

Bring forth therefore fruit worthy of repentance:,Ngɑ di sɛ wɑ wom tɛgbei cɛbɛ kɑ ɑ̀ sɑbɑ ndɑ tuubiyom.

"Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to the Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him.","Sɑɑ di no Yesu hunu zɑ Gɑlile kɑ kɑɑ Yudum isɑ Yohɑnnɑ dɔ, ɑ̀ mɑ ngɑ mirɑndi."
"But John would have hindered him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?","Ammɑ Yohɑnnɑ go hungu ɑ̀ sɛ ndɑ gɑɑbi kɑ cii: Hɛɛ wɔ ɑ̀ himɑ ni, n mɑ ɑ mirɑndi, cɔfɔ n kɑɑ ɑ dɔ?"

"For in that she poured this ointment upon my body, she did it to prepare me for burial.","Ammɑ wei wɔ, ɑ̀ wɑidi wɔ kɑ ɑ̀ munu ɑ bɔm, ɑ̀ nɑ ɑ̀ tɛ no ɑ gɑɑhɑm fijiyom sɛ."

"Then one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests,","Coobɑɑbɑize wei cindi hinkɑ di ǹ ŋmɔne ɑfɔ kɑ ǹ cii ɑ̀ sɛ Yudɑ Isikɑriɔtu, ɑ̀ kpei gɑrɑndikɔ jinɑ yom dɔ."

And from that time he sought opportunity to deliver him unto them.,Zɑ sɑɑ di no ɑ̀ go ceeci zɑngɑ ngɑ mɑ tɛ kɑ Yesu dɑm kɑmbɛ.
"Now on the first day of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Where wilt thou that we make ready for thee to eat the passover?","Buuru Kɑsɑmi Si jingɑru hɑnu sintinɑ, coobɑɑbɑize yom di kɑɑ sendi Yesu sɛ. Ǹ cii: Mɑni no n go bɑɑ i mɑ Bɔmdɑɑrum jingɑru wɔ sɔlu n mɑ ŋmɑɑ?"

"And when they had sung a hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.","Kɑ ǹ nɑ betu fɔ tɛ, ǹ hunu kɑ kpei Olibe zugu tondi kuku dɔ."

"But after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee.","Ammɑ ɑ tunɑndiyom bɑndɑ, ɑ wom jinɑ Gɑlile lɑɑbu."

"He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my sayings, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I spake, the same shall judge him in the last day.","Hɛɛ wɔ, ɑ kɑɑ no zɑngɑ kɑɑri hɑndunyɑ kunɑ domi bɔrɔ kulu kɑ ɑ̀ go nɑɑne ɑ gɑɑ ɑ̀ mɑ si gɔrɔ kube."

"Now before the feast of the passover, Jesus knowing that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father, having loved his own that were in the world, he loved them unto the end.","Yɑ nɑ sendi ɑ bɔm gɑɑ, ɑmmɑ Bɑɑbɑ kɑ ɑ̀ nɑ ɑ dɔntɔm.

"And during supper, the devil having already put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son, to betray him,","A go bei mo kɑ ɑ̀ meire yɑ hundi no kɑ ɑ̀ si beeni. À sɛ no, hɛ yom kɑ ɑ go cii, ɑ go cii no zɑngɑ Bɑɑbɑ cii ɑ sɛ."

"Then he poureth water into the basin, and began to wash the disciples’ feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded.",Yesu go bei Bɑɑbɑ nɑ hɛ kulu dɑm ngɑ kɑmbɛ. A go bei mo ngɑ hunu Bɑɑbɑ dɔ. À go ye mo Bɑɑbɑ dɔ.

"And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple. Now that disciple was known unto the high priest, and entered in with Jesus into the court of the high priest;","Ǹ kpeindɑ Yesu Hɑnɑnu dɔ sintine zɑmɑ Kɑifɑ kɑ ɑ̀ tɛ gɑrɑndikɔ beeri jiiri wɔ, Hɑnɑnu hɑnzure no."

"When therefore the chief priests and the officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify him, crucify him!

"Pilate therefore saith unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest thou not that I have power to release thee, and have power to crucify thee?","Sɑɑ kɑ Pilɑtu mɑɑ sendi ngɑ di, ɑ̀ hɑmburu kɑ tɔntɔnu."
"Jesus answered him, Thou wouldest have no power against me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath greater sin.",Cɔfɔ ɑ̀ huro ciiti kɑtɑ kunɑ kɑ cii Yesu sɛ: Ni mɑni bɔrɔ no? Ammɑ Yesu mɑnɑ tu kɑ yeti ɑ̀ sɛ.
"Upon this Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou release this man, thou art not Cæsar’s friend: every one that maketh himself a king speaketh against Cæsar.","Pilɑtu cii ɑ̀ sɛ: N si sendi ɑ sɛ no? N si bei ɑ gundɑ hini kɑ n kɑnji bɑ, ɑ gundɑ hini kɑ n tɑm?"
"When Pilate therefore heard these words, he brought Jesus out, and sat down on the judgment-seat at a place called The Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha.","Yesu tu kɑ cii: N si du hini fɔ kulu ɑ bɔm de ɑ̀ mɑnɑ ci zɑ bɛɛnɛ no ǹ nɑ n no ndɑ.

"They therefore cried out, Away with him, away with him, crucify him! Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King?

Then therefore he delivered him unto them to be crucified.,"Bɔmdɑɑrum jingɑru sɔluyom hɑnu hine no zɑngɑ zɑɑri mɑɑnɑntɛ zɑkɑ. À cii Yuifu yom sɛ: Gunɑ, wom Kpe go."
"They took Jesus therefore: and he went out, bearing the cross for himself, unto the place called The place of a skull, which is called in Hebrew Golgotha:","Ammɑ ǹ kuwɑ: À kɑɑ, ɑ̀ kɑɑ.

"And Pilate wrote a title also, and put it on the cross. And there was written, JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.","Yesu hunu kɑ ngɑ bundu gɑɑrɑntɛ jɛrɛ. Ǹ kpeindɑɑ̀ nungu fɔ kɑ ǹ cii ɑ̀ sɛ Bɔm Kurumbu, Ebulu cinɛ no ǹ cii ɑ̀ sɛ no Gologɑtɑ."
"This title therefore read many of the Jews, for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city; and it was written in Hebrew, and in Latin, and in Greek.","Nungu di no ǹ nɑ ɑ̀ kɑnji, ngɑ ndɑ bɔrɔ hinkɑ fɔ, bɔrɔ fɔ fɔ ɑ̀ cɔrɔ kulu gɑɑ. Yesu mo goono bindi kunɑ."
"The chief priests of the Jews therefore said to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but, that he said, I am King of the Jews.","Pilɑtu nɑ hɑntum fɔ tɛ kɑ dɑm bundu gɑɑrɑntɛ gɑɑ. Ngɑ no ǹ hɑntum neyɑ: YESU NAZARA, YUIFU YOM KPE."

"The soldiers therefore, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also the coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.","Yuifu yom gɑrɑndikɔ jinɑ yom di cii Pilɑtu sɛ: Si hɑntum Yuifu yom Kpe, ɑmmɑ ǹ mɑ hɑntum: À cii ngɑ yɑ Yuifu yom Kpe no."
"They said therefore one to another, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my garments among them, And upon my vesture did they cast lots.","Pilɑtu tu kɑ cii: Hɛ kɑ ɑ hɑntum, ɑ nɑ ɑ̀ hɑntum kɔ."
"These things therefore the soldiers did. But there were standing by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.","Sɑɑ kɑ wɑnguize yom nɑ Yesu kɑnji ǹ nɑ ɑ̀ jiine yom zɑɑ kɑ ǹ tɛ gusɑm tɑɑci.

"When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold, thy son!","Ǹ cii cɛrɛ sɛ: I mɑ si ɑ̀ pɑti ɑmmɑ i mɑ tɛtɛ tɛ ɑ̀ bɔm bɔrɔ kɑ ɑ̀ du ɑ̀.

"Then saith he to the disciple, Behold, thy mother! And from that hour the disciple took her unto his own home.","Yesu bundu gɑɑrɑntɑ jɛrɛ gɑɑ, ɑ̀ nyɑ gɑ cɛ ndɑ ɑ̀ nyɑ cɛɛnɛ Mɑriɑmɑ, Celopɑ wɛndɛ ndɑ Mɑriɑmɑ Mɑgɑdɑliɑ."
"After this Jesus, knowing that all things are now finished, that the scripture might be accomplished, saith, I thirst.","Kɑ Yesu di ngɑ nyɑ ndɑ coobɑɑbɑize kɑ ɑ̀ bine bɑɑ, ǹ go cɛ nodi, ɑ̀ cii ngɑ nyɑ sɛ: Wei wɔ, gunɑ n koo."
"There was set there a vessel full of vinegar: so they put a sponge full of the vinegar upon hyssop, and brought it to his mouth.","Cɔfɔ ɑ̀ cii coobɑɑbɑize di sɛ: Gunɑ n nyɑ. Zɑ lɔkɑci ngɑ di, coobɑɑbɑize di nɑ Yesu nyɑ zɑɑ ngɑ kpɑɑrɑ."

"The Jews therefore, because it was the Preparation, that the bodies should not remain on the cross upon the sabbath (for the day of that sabbath was a high day), asked of Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.",Gulɑ fɔ bine goono nodi kɑ ɑ̀ tɔ ndɑ hɑri mɔrɔ.

"And after these things Joseph of Arimathæa, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, asked of Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore, and took away his body.","Nge yom di tɛ no domi ǹ mɑ Ikpɛ Sendi hɑntumɑntɛ tɔnɑndi kɑ ɑ̀ cii: ""Ǹ si ɑ̀ biri yom, bɑ ɑfɔ ceeri""."

"So they took the body of Jesus, and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as the custom of the Jews is to bury.","Nge yom di bɑndɑ, Yosɛfu Alimɑte bɔrɔ, Yesu coobɑɑbɑize nɑ tugɑntɛ Yuifu yom hɑmbure sɑbu sɛ, ɑ̀ nɑ Pilɑtu ŋmɑɑrɛ ngɑ mɑ Yesu gɑɑhɑm kɑɑ bundɑ gɑɑ.

"When therefore it was evening, on that day, the first day of the week, and when the doors were shut where the disciples were, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you.","Yesu cii ɑ̀ sɛ: Si ɑ hɑmɑ zɑmɑ ɑ mɑnɑ kpei bɛɛnɛ ɑ Bɑɑbɑ dɔ jinɑ.

"The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the Lord.

"Many other signs therefore did Jesus in the presence of the disciples, which are not written in this book:","Tomɑ tu kɑ cii ɑ̀ sɛ: A Kpe, ɑ ŋmɔne Ikpɛ."
"but these are written, that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye may have life in his name.","Yesu cii ɑ̀ sɛ: Zɑ kɑ n di hɛɛ, n nɑɑne. Binekɑɑnekpɛ yom no beerem kɑ ǹ mɑnɑ di ɑmmɑ ǹ gɑ nɑɑne."

"That disciple therefore whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is the Lord. So when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his coat about him (for he was naked), and cast himself into the sea.","Yesu cii ǹ sɛ: Koo yom wɔ, wom gundɑ ŋmɑɑri bɑ? Ǹ tu ɑ̀ sɛ kɑ cii: Awo."
"But the other disciples came in the little boat (for they were not far from the land, but about two hundred cubits off), dragging the net full of fishes.","À cii ǹ sɛ: Wɑ biriji see hɑrihiɑ sɛ kɑmbɛŋmɑɑ, wom kɑɑ du. Ǹ nɑ ɑ̀ see. Mɑɑsɑ ǹ mɑnɑ hini kɑ ɑ̀ cendi ndɑ ciifi bɑyom."

"What then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather, hath found according to the flesh?",Ikpɛ fɔlɔnku yɑ gɑ bɑnguize yom cɛɑndi susu nɑɑne gɑɑ. À go zɑm kɑ dɑmbɑnguize yom mo cɛɑndi susu nɑɑne gɑɑ.
"For if Abraham was justified by works, he hath whereof to glory; but not toward God.","Yɑ di gɑɑ, i gɑ fɔndɑ tɛ kɔnu nɑɑne dɔ no? Awo. Kɑlɑ i go fɔndɑ gɔrɛndi dee."
"For what saith the scripture? And Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned unto him for righteousness.",Ifɔ no i mɑ cii i cɛɛ Abulɛmɑ du kɑ simbɑ ndɑ gɑɑhɑm?
"Now to him that worketh, the reward is not reckoned as of grace, but as of debt.","De Ikpɛ nɑ Abulɛmɑ cɛɑndi susu fɔndɑ tɛgbei gɑɑ, ɑ̀ tɔ ɑ̀ mɑ fɑɑre ɑmmɑ ɑ̀ mɑnɑ ci Ikpɛ jine."
"But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is reckoned for righteousness.","Ifɔ no Ikpɛ Sendɑ cii? À cii: ""Abulɛmɑ nɑɑne Ikpɛ. Ikpɛ nɑ cɛɑndiyom susu lɑsɑbu ɑ̀ sɛ""."
"Even as David also pronounceth blessing upon the man, unto whom God reckoneth righteousness apart from works,","Bɔrɔ kɑ ɑ̀ go gbei tɛ, ǹ si bɑnɑndi lɑsɑbu zɑngɑ gomini, ɑmmɑ zɑngɑ hɛ kɑ ɑ̀ tilɑsi ɑkpɛ mɑ du."
"saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, And whose sins are covered.","Ammɑ Ikpɛ go bɔrɔ kɑ ɑ̀ si kɑ ɑ̀ gɑnɑ cɛɑndi susu. Bɔrɔ kɑ ɑ̀ si gbei tɛ ɑmmɑ ɑ̀ go nɑɑne Ikpɛ gɑɑ, Ikpɛ go cɛɑndiyom susu lɑsɑbu ɑ̀ sɛ."
Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not reckon sin.,"Yɑ no Dɑfidi go bɔrɔ fɔ bɑrikɑ deede, bɔrɔ fɔ kɑ Ikpɛ go cɛɑndiyom susu lɑsɑbu ɑ̀ sɛ, fɔndɑ tɛgbei yom si. À cii:"
"Is this blessing then pronounced upon the circumcision, or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say, To Abraham his faith was reckoned for righteousness.","""Binekɑɑnekpɛ yom no beerem wɔ kɑ Ikpɛ nɑ ǹ yɑɑfɑ ndɑ ǹ ilɑlɔ tɛyom, beerem kɑ Ikpɛ nɑ ǹ dulum yom dɑɑbu mo."
"How then was it reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision:","Binekɑɑnekpɛ no, bɔrɔ kɑ Kpe si dulum lɑsɑbu ɑ̀ sɛ."""
"and he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had while he was in uncircumcision: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be in uncircumcision, that righteousness might be reckoned unto them;","Sɑɑ kɑ Ikpɛ gɑ bɑrikɑ dɑm zɑngɑ yɑ, ɑ̀ gɑ kɑ ɑ̀ dɑm bɑnguize yom hinne sɛ no dee wɑlɑ ndɑ zɑm kɑ dɑmbɑnguize yom mo sɛ?

"and the father of circumcision to them who not only are of the circumcision, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham which he had in uncircumcision.",Mɛtɛ no Ikpɛ nɑ ɑ̀ lɑsɑbu ɑ̀ sɛ?

"For not through the law was the promise to Abraham or to his seed that he should be heir of the world, but through the righteousness of faith.","À du bɑngudɑmyom ɑlɑmu zɑngɑ cɛɑndiyom susu sɛdɑ dɑmyom noyɑ kɑ ɑ̀ du nɑɑne gɑɑ ɑ̀ zɑm kɑ dɑmbɑngu kunɑ.

"For if they that are of the law are heirs, faith is made void, and the promise is made of none effect:","À mɑ ci bɑɑbɑ bɑnguize yom sɛ mo.

"for the law worketh wrath; but where there is no law, neither is there transgression.",Ikpɛ nɑ ɑlikɑwɑli tɛ Abulɛmɑ sɛ ndɑ ɑ̀ bɑndɑ sɛ ɑ̀ mɑ ci hɑndunyɑ tubukɔ. À mɑnɑ ɑlikɑwɑli di tɛ Moisi fɔndɑ dɔ ɑmmɑ cɛɑndiyom susu dɔ nɑɑne gɑɑ.
"For this cause it is of faith, that it may be according to grace; to the end that the promise may be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all","De Moisi fɔndɑ gɑnɑkɔ yom tɛ tubukɔ yom, nɑɑne tɛ kɔnu noyɑ. Alikɑwɑlɑ mo si hɛ fɔ kulu jɑrɑ."
"(as it is written, A father of many nations have I made thee) before him whom he believed, even God, who giveth life to the dead, and calleth the things that are not, as though they were.","Moisi fɔndɑ wɔ binetɔnɛ no ɑ̀ go kɑɑndɑ. Nungu kɑ Moisi fɔndɑ si, fɔndɑ dɑɑrumyom mo si nodi."
"Who in hope believed against hope, to the end that he might become a father of many nations, according to that which had been spoken, So shall thy seed be.","À sɛ no, ɑlikɑwɑli goono nɑɑne gɑɑ zɑmɑ ɑ̀ mɑ goono gomini dɔ hɑli ɑlikɑwɑli mɑ tɑbɑi ɑ̀ bɑndɑ kulu sɛ.

"And without being weakened in faith he considered his own body now as good as dead (he being about a hundred years old), and the deadness of Sarah’s womb;","Zɑngɑ Ikpɛ Sendi hɑntumɑntɛ cii: ""A nɑ n gɔrɛndi dimi boobo sɛ bɑɑbɑ"".

"yet, looking unto the promise of God, he wavered not through unbelief, but waxed strong through faith, giving glory to God,","Abulɛmɑ gɑ bɛɛjɛ kɑ nɑɑne, bɑ kɑ bɛɛjɛ hɛ si. À gɑɑ no ɑ̀ tɛ dimi boobo sɛ bɑɑbɑ, hɛ kɑ ǹ cii ɑ̀ sɛ bɔm: ""Zɑngɑ n bɑndɑ yom kɑɑ bɑrɑ noyɑ""."
"and being fully assured that what he had promised, he was able also to perform.","Abulɛmɑ mɑnɑ zɑm gɑɑbi nɑɑne kunɑ. À mɑnɑ gunɑ ngɑ gɑɑhɑm bu kɔ zɑmɑ ɑ̀ tɔ zɑngɑ jiiri zɑngu. À mɑnɑ gunɑ mo kɑ Sɑhɑrɑ gunde bu, ɑ̀ si hɛi."
Wherefore also it was reckoned unto him for righteousness.,A mɑnɑ siikɑ kɑ zɑm kɑ nɑɑne Ikpɛ ɑlikɑwɑlɑ gɑɑ kɑlɑ kɑ ɑ̀ du gɑɑbi nɑɑne dɔ kɑ Ikpɛ bɛɛrɑndi.
"Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was reckoned unto him;","À bei dɑhiri ɑlikɑwɑli kɑ Ikpɛ tɛ, Ikpɛ gundɑ dɑbɑri kɑ ɑ̀ tɔnɑndi."
"but for our sake also, unto whom it shall be reckoned, who believe on him that raised Jesus our Lord from the dead,","À sɛ nɑ, Ikpɛ nɑ Abulɛmɑ nɑɑne lɑsɑbu ɑ̀ sɛ cɛɑndiyom susu."
"who was delivered up for our trespasses, and was raised for our justification.",À mɑnɑ ci ngɑ hinne sɛ nɑ ǹ nɑ ɑ̀ hɑntum kɑ cii Ikpɛ nɑ cɛɑndiyom susu lɑsɑbu ɑ̀ sɛ.
"Being therefore justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ;","Ammɑ i yom mo, i sɑbu sɛ Ikpɛ gɑ kɑ ɑ̀ lɑsɑbu i sɛ, i yom kɑ i gɑ nɑɑne Ikpɛ gɑɑ. Ngɑ yɑ nɑ i Kpe Yesu tunɑndi bukɔei gɑme."
through whom also we have had our access by faith into this grace wherein we stand; and we rejoice in hope of the glory of God.,Ikpɛ nɑ ɑ̀ dɑm kɑmbɛ i tɑɑli yom sɑbu sɛ. À nɑ ɑ̀ tunɑndi mo zɑmɑ ɑ̀ mɑ i cɛɑndi susu.
"And not only so, but we also rejoice in our tribulations: knowing that tribulation worketh stedfastness;","Ngɑ di sɛ, zɑ kɑ Ikpɛ nɑ i cɛɑndi susu nɑɑne gɑɑ, bɑɑni tɛ i yom ndɑ Ikpɛ gɑme i Kpe Yesu Mɛsiyɑ dɔ."
"and stedfastness, approvedness; and approvedness, hope:",À dɔ nɑ i yom mo i du fɔndɔ kɑ huro gomini kunɑ nɑɑne gɑɑ. Gominɑ kunɑ no i go sinji kɑ boori. I go fɑihã mo kɑ bɛɛjɛ sinji Ikpɛ deizɑ gɑɑ.
and hope putteth not to shame; because the love of God hath been shed abroad in our hearts through the Holy Spirit which was given unto us.,"Bɑ ngɑ di bɑ si, i go fɑihã mo bɑ kɑnkɑmi yom kunɑ ko bei kɑ kɑnkɑmi wɔ kokɑri no ɑ̀ cini hɛi."
"For while we were yet weak, in due season Christ died for the ungodly.",Kokɑri mo go kɑɑndɑ dɑɑ tɑbɑtɑntɛ bubure kunɑ. Dɑɑ tɑbɑtɑntɛ mo go kɑɑndɑ bɛɛjɛ.
For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: for peradventure for the good man some one would even dare to die.,"Bɛɛjɛ bine si bɔrɔ dɑm hɑwi pɑi, zɑmɑ Biyɑ Hɑlɑɑlɑ kɑ Ikpɛ nɑ i no, ɑ̀ nɑ Ikpɛ bɑɑkɑsine dooru i bine yom kunɑ."
"But God commendeth his own love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.","Sɑɑ kɑ i goono gɑɑbi si, lɔkɑci kɑ ɑ̀ tɔ no Mɛsiyɑ bu beerem sɛ kɑ ǹ si kɑ Ikpɛ gɑnɑ."
"Much more then, being now justified by his blood, shall we be saved from the wrath of God through him.","Kɑlɑ dɑcɑti bɔrɔ du kɑ bu bɔrɔ kɑ ɑ̀ cɛsusu sɛ, ɑmmɑ hɑnibɑ bɔrɔ yɑru kɑ bu bɔrɔ hinno sɛ."
"For if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, shall we be saved by his life;","Ammɑ Ikpɛ gɑ kɑ ngɑ bɑɑkɑsine cɛbɛ i sɛ, sɑɑ kɑ i goono ko ci dulumkoni yom, Mɛsiyɑ bu i sɛ."
"and not only so, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation.","Hɑli yɑ mɑ mɑɑsɑ Ikpɛ nɑ i cɛɑndi susu Mɛsiyɑ kuri gɑɑ. À sɛ no, Ikpɛ gɑ i fɑɑbɑ ngɑ binetɔnɛ kɑmbɛ Mɛsiyɑ dɔ."
"Therefore, as through one man sin entered into the world, and death through sin; and so death passed unto all men, for that all sinned:—","Zɑ sɑɑ kɑ i gɑ ci Ikpɛ ŋmɔne ibɛrɛ yom ɑ̀ nɑ i yom ndɑ ngɑ sɑsɑbɑndi ɑ̀ Ize bu gɑɑ. Hɑli yɑ mɑ zɑ kɑ Ikpɛ nɑ i sɑsɑbɑndi, ɑ̀ gɑ i fɑɑbɑ ndɑ ɑ̀ Ize hundi."
for until the law sin was in the world; but sin is not imputed when there is no law.,"Bɑ nge yom di bɑ si mɑ, i gɑ fɑihã kpɛɛnɛ Ikpɛ kunɑ i Kpe Yesu Mɛsiyɑ dɔ. Yesu Mɛsiyɑ dɔ nɑ mɑɑsɑ Ikpɛ nɑ i sɑsɑbɑndi."
"Nevertheless death reigned from Adam until Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the likeness of Adam’s transgression, who is a figure of him that was to come.",Bɔrɔ fɔlɔnku dɔ dulum huro hɑndunyɑ. Dulum mo sɑbu sɛ bu huro. À sɛ no zɑngɑ yɑ bu dirɑ bɔrɔ kulu bɔm zɑmɑ bɔrɔ kulu nɑ dulum tɛ.
"But not as the trespass, so also is the free gift. For if by the trespass of the one the many died, much more did the grace of God, and the gift by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, abound unto the many.","Kɑlɑ Moisi fɔndɑ wɑtɛ dulum goono hɑndunyɑ kunɑ, ɑmmɑ ǹ si kɑ ɑ̀ lɑsɑbu zɑngɑ dulum sɑɑ kɑ Moisi fɔndɑ si."
"And not as through one that sinned, so is the gift: for the judgment came of one unto condemnation, but the free gift came of many trespasses unto justification.",Ndɑ ɑ̀ kulu bu dɑbɑri zɑ Adɑmu bɔm kɑlɑ Moisi bɔm. Bu dɑbɑri beerem bɔm kɑ ǹ mɑnɑ dulum tɛ zɑngɑ Adɑmu ŋmɔne dimi. Adɑmu yɑ ci bɔrɔ kɑ yɑ kɑɑ himɑi.
"For if, by the trespass of the one, death reigned through the one; much more shall they that receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one, even Jesus Christ.","Ammɑ gomini noyom cɛ ɑ̀ mɑnɑ ci zɑngɑ dɛrɛyom wɔ. Bɔrɔ fɔlɔnku dɛrɛyom gɑɑ jɑmɑ bu. Hɑli yɑ mo Ikpɛ gomini ndɑ gomini noyom kɑ ɑ̀ hunu bɔrɔ fɔlɔnku dɔ Yesu Mɛsiyɑ, ngɑ di bɑ kɑ tɔntɔnu jɑmɑ sɛ."
So then as through one trespass the judgment came unto all men to condemnation; even so through one act of righteousness the free gift came unto all men to justification of life.,"Ikpɛ noyom wɔ, ɑ̀ mɑnɑ ci zɑngɑ noyom kɑ ɑ̀ hunu bɔrɔ fɔlɔnku dɔ kɑ ɑ̀ nɑ dulum tɛ. Bɔrɔ fɔlɔnku tɑɑli kɑɑndɑ ciiti kɑ zeeri. Ammɑ Ikpɛ gomini noyom kɑɑ dɛrɛyom boobo bɑndɑ kɑ kɑɑndɑ cɛɑndiyom susu."
"For as through the one man’s disobedience the many were made sinners, even so through the obedience of the one shall the many be made righteous.","Bɔrɔ fɔlɔnku dɛrɛyom gɑɑ bu go dɑbɑri bɔrɔ kulu bɔm. Yɑ mo beerem kɑ ǹ go du gomini ndɑ bɑyom ndɑ noyom kɑ ɑ̀ kɑɑndɑ cɛɑndiyom susu, ǹ kɑɑ dɑbɑri hundi kunɑ bɔrɔ fɔlɔnku dɔ, Yesu Mɛsiyɑ."
"And the law came in besides, that the trespass might abound; but where sin abounded, grace did abound more exceedingly:","Yɑ di gɑɑ zɑngɑ dɛrɛyom fɔlɔnku gɑɑ ciiti kɑ zeeri kɑɑ bɔrɔ kulu gɑɑ. Yɑ no cɛyom susu tɛyom fɔlɔnku gɑɑ, cɛɑndiyom susu kɑ ɑ̀ go hundi no ɑ̀ tɔ bɔrɔ kulu gɑɑ."
"that, as sin reigned in death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.","Bɔrɔ fɔlɔnku zɑm kɑ gɑnɑ kunɑ bɔrɔ boobo tɛ dulumkoni. Yɑ mo no bɔrɔ fɔlɔnku ŋmɔne gɑnɑyom kunɑ, Ikpɛ kɑɑ bɔrɔ boobo tɛ cɛɑntɛ susu."
"What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?","Moisi fɔndɑ kɑɑ no zɑmɑ dɛrɛyom mɑ bɑ. Ammɑ nungu kɑ dulum bɑ, gomini bɑ kɑ bisɑ."
"God forbid. We who died to sin, how shall we any longer live therein?","Dulum dɑbɑri bu kunɑ. Yɑ no gomini mo mɑ dɑbɑri cɛɑndiyom susu kunɑ hundi kɑ ɑ̀ si beeni sɛ, i Kpe Yesu Mɛsiyɑ dɔ."
Or are ye ignorant that all we who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?,Yɑ di gɑɑ ifɔ i mɑ cii? I bo dulum tɛ zɑmɑ gomini mɑ bɑ sɛ?
"We were buried therefore with him through baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we also might walk in newness of life.","Awo. À si tɛ. I yom kɑ i bu dulum sɛ, mɛtɛ i kɑɑ tɛ ko hunɑ kpɛɛnɛ dulum kunɑ?"
"For if we have become united with him in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection;","Wom bei kɑ i kulu kɑ i du mirɑndiyom Mɛsiyɑ Yesu kunɑ, ɑ̀ bu kunɑ no i du mirɑndiyom. À nɑ ci cimi no bɑ?"
"knowing this, that our old man was crucified with him, that the body of sin might be done away, that so we should no longer be in bondage to sin;","Yɑ di gɑɑ ǹ nɑ i fiji ɑ̀ bɑndɑ mirɑndiyom dɔ ɑ̀ bu kunɑ. Zɑngɑ ǹ nɑ Mɛsiyɑ tunɑndi bukɔei gɑme Bɑɑbɑ dɑbɑri deizɑkpɛ gɑɑ, yɑ no i yom i mo dirɑ hundi teji kunɑ."
for he that hath died is justified from sin.,"Zɑ kɑ i tɛ ɑfɔ ndɑ Mɛsiyɑ ɑ̀ bu himɑndi kunɑ, yɑ no i kɑɑ tɛ ɑfɔ ɑ̀ tunɑndiyom himɑndi kunɑ."
"But if we died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him;",I gɑ bei kɑ Ikpɛ nɑ i bine kunɑ bɔrɔ zeenɔ kɑnji Mɛsiyɑ bɑndɑ zɑmɑ ɑ̀ mɑ dulum dɑbɑri hɑlɑci. Yɑ di gɑɑ i mɑ si tɑmtɛrɛ dulum sɛ kpɛɛnɛ.
knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death no more hath dominion over him.,"Bɔrɔ kɑ ɑ̀ bu, ɑ̀ kɔmɑ dulum kɑmbɛ noyɑ."
"For the death that he died, he died unto sin once: but the life that he liveth, he liveth unto God.","Bine, zɑ kɑ i bu Mɛsiyɑ bɑndɑ, i gɑ nɑɑne i kɑɑ hunɑ ɑ̀ bɑndɑ mɑ."
"Even so reckon ye also yourselves to be dead unto sin, but alive unto God in Christ Jesus.","I gɑ bei Mɛsiyɑ kɑ Ikpɛ tunɑndi bukɔei gɑme, ɑ̀ si bu kpɛɛnɛ. Bu sindɑ dɑbɑri ɑ̀ bɔm kpɛɛnɛ."
"Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey the lusts thereof:","Bu kɑ ɑ̀ tɛ, dulum sɛ no ɑ̀ bu ce fɔ pɑp. Ammɑ hunɑyom kɑ ɑ̀ go tɛ, Ikpɛ sɛ no ɑ̀ go hunɑ."
"neither present your members unto sin as instruments of unrighteousness; but present yourselves unto God, as alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God.","Zɑngɑ yɑ wom mo, wɑ wom bɔm lɑsɑbu zɑngɑ bukɔ yom dulum sɛ. Wɑ wom bɔm lɑsɑbu wom yɑ hundikoni yom no Ikpɛ sɛ Mɛsiyɑ Yesu kunɑ."
"For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under law, but under grace.","Ngɑ di sɛ, wɑ si nɑm dulum mɑ dɑbɑri wom gɑɑhɑm yom kɑ ǹ bu bɔm hɑli wom mɑ ǹ bineibɑɑi gɑnɑ."
"What then? shall we sin, because we are not under law, but under grace? God forbid.","Wɑ si wom dɔbu yom no dulum sɛ zɑngɑ ilɑlɔ tɛyom hɛ. Ammɑ wɑ wom bɔm no Ikpɛ sɛ zɑngɑ bukɔ yom kɑ Ikpɛ nɑ ǹ hunɑndi. Wom dɔbu yom mo, wɑ ǹ no Ikpɛ sɛ cɛyom susu tɛyom hɛ."
"Know ye not, that to whom ye present yourselves as servants unto obedience, his servants ye are whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?","Dulum si ye kɑ dɑbɑri wom bɔm, zɑmɑ wom si fɔndɑ cire ɑmmɑ wom goono gomini cire."
"But thanks be to God, that, whereas ye were servants of sin, ye became obedient from the heart to that form of teaching whereunto ye were delivered;","Yɑ di gɑɑ, i mɑ dulum tɛ me, zɑmɑ i si fɔndɑ cire kɑlɑ gomini cire? Awo. À si tɛ."
"and being made free from sin, ye became servants of righteousness.","Bɔrɔ kulu kɑ ɑ̀ sɛ wom no wom bɔm no zɑngɑ tɑm yom kɑ ɑ̀ gɑnɑ, wom tɛ bɔrɔ di kpɛ tɑm yom noyɑ. Wom go yɑ di bei bɑ?

"I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye presented your members as servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity, even so now present your members as servants to righteousness unto sanctification.","Ammɑ i mɑ Ikpɛ sɑɑbu zɑmɑ sɑɑ kɑ wom go ci dulum tɑm yom, wom nɑ cɛbɛ dimi fɔ gɑnɑ ndɑ bine fɔ, cɛbɛ kɑ ɑ̀ kunɑ Ikpɛ nɑ wom dɑm."
"For when ye were servants of sin, ye were free in regard of righteousness.","Zɑ kɑ Ikpɛ nɑ wom fɑnsɑ dulum gɑɑ, wom tɛ cɛɑndiyom susu tɑm yom noyɑ."
What fruit then had ye at that time in the things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death.,"Wom hɑɑli yom kɑ ǹ sindɑ gɑɑbi, ɑ̀ sɑbu sɛ nɑ ɑ go sendi zɑngɑ iburɑdɑm yom go cii.

"But now being made free from sin and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto sanctification, and the end eternal life.","Sɑɑ kɑ wom go ci dulum tɑm yom, cɛɑndiyom susu sindɑ dɑbɑri wom bɔm."
For the wages of sin is death; but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.,"Ngɑ di sɛ, hɛ yom wɔ kɑ hɑwi go wom dii ndei mɑɑsɑ, dom di bɑrikɑ fɔ no wom du ǹ gɑɑ? Hɛ nge yom di beenɑntɛ yɑ ci bu."
"Or are ye ignorant, brethren (for I speak to men who know the law), that the law hath dominion over a man for so long time as he liveth?",Ammɑ mɑɑsɑ Ikpɛ nɑ wom fɑnsɑ dulum gɑɑ. Wom tɛ ɑ̀ tɑm yom. Wom gundɑ wom bɑrikɑ hɑlɑɑlɑtɛrɛ kunɑ kɑ ɑ̀ gɑ kɑɑndɑ hundi kɑ ɑ̀ si beeni.
"For the woman that hath a husband is bound by law to the husband while he liveth; but if the husband die, she is discharged from the law of the husband.","Dulum bɑnɑndi yɑ ci bu, ɑmmɑ Ikpɛ gomini noyom yɑ ci hundi kɑ ɑ̀ si beeni i Kpe Mɛsiyɑ Yesu kunɑ."
"So then if, while the husband liveth, she be joined to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if the husband die, she is free from the law, so that she is no adulteress, though she be joined to another man.","Nyɑizei, Moisi fɔndɑ bo dɑbɑri bɔrɔ bɔm no kɑlɑ ɑ̀ hundi mee. Wom go yɑ di bei bɑ? Beerem kɑ ǹ go Moisi fɔndɑ bei, ǹ sɛ no ɑ go sendi."
"Wherefore, my brethren, ye also were made dead to the law through the body of Christ; that ye should be joined to another, even to him who was raised from the dead, that we might bring forth fruit unto God.","Yɑ no Moisi fɔndɑ go weihiji hɔ ɑ̀ kunye gɑɑ de kunye di go hunɑ. Ammɑ de kunyɑ bu, wɛndɑ kɔmɑ fɔndɑ gɑɑ, fɔndɑ kɑ ɑ̀ go kɑ ɑ̀ hɔ ndɑ kunyɑ."
"For when we were in the flesh, the sinful passions, which were through the law, wrought in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.","Ammɑ kunyɑ bɑhune kunɑ, de ɑ̀ nɑ hɑibɔrɔ ŋmɑni fɔ hiji, zinɑteeri no ǹ gɑ ɑ̀ cɛɛ. Ammɑ de kunyɑ bu, ɑ̀ hunu fɔndɔ ngɑ di kunɑ noyɑ. À mɑnɑ ci zinɑ de ɑ̀ nɑ hɑibɔrɔ teji hiji."
"But now we have been discharged from the law, having died to that wherein we were held; so that we serve in newness of the spirit, and not in oldness of the letter.","A sɛ no ɑ nyɑizei, wom bu Moisi fɔndɑ sɛ Mɛsiyɑ gɑɑhɑm dɔ zɑmɑ wom mɑ tɛ bɔrɔ fɔ ŋmɑni ŋmɔne yom.

"What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Howbeit, I had not known sin, except through the law: for I had not known coveting, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet:","Sɑɑ kɑ i goono dulum hɑɑli kunɑ dulum ŋmɔne bɑɑyom futei kɑ Moisi fɔndɑ nɑ ǹ fum, ǹ nɑ gbei tɛ i dɔbu yom kunɑ hɑli i mɑ nɑfɑ bu sɛ."
"but sin, finding occasion, wrought in me through the commandment all manner of coveting: for apart from the law sin is dead.","Ammɑ mɑɑsɑ, bu nɑ i feeri Moisi fɔndɑ gɑɑ zɑ kɑ fɔndɑ kɑ ɑ̀ nɑ i dii, i bu ɑ̀ dɔ.

"And I was alive apart from the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died;","Yɑ di gɑɑ ifɔ i mɑ cii? Moisi fɔndɑ dulum no bɑ? Awo. À si tɛ. Ammɑ yɑ nɑ dulum bei de ɑ̀ mɑnɑ ci Moisi fɔndɑ gɑɑ. Yɑ no ɑ mɑnɑ bɑɑyom futu bei de Moisi fɔndɑ mɑnɑ cii: ""N mɑ si bɑɑyom futu tɛ""."
"and the commandment, which was unto life, this I found to be unto death:","Ammɑ kɑ dulum du dɑɑmɑ meire dɔ, ɑ̀ nɑ bɑɑyom futu dimi kulu hɛi ɑ̀ kunɑ. De Moisi fɔndɑ si, dulum mo si."
"for sin, finding occasion, through the commandment beguiled me, and through it slew me.","Hɛɛ wɔ, sɑɑ kɑ ɑ goono ɑ sindɑ Moisi fɔndɑ, ɑ gɑ hunɑ. Ammɑ kɑ meire kɑɑ, dulum tɛ hundi. Cɔfɔ ɑ bu."
"So that the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and righteous, and good.","Meire mo kɑ ɑ̀ ci hundi ŋmɔne, ɑ gɑru ɑ̀ tɛ ɑ sɛ bu ŋmɔne."
"Did then that which is good become death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might be shown to be sin, by working death to me through that which is good;—that through the commandment sin might become exceeding sinful.",Kɑ dulum du dɑɑmɑ meire dɔ ɑ̀ nɑ ɑ zɑmbɑ ndɑ meire kɑ ɑ wi ndɑ meire.
"For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.","À sɛ no, Moisi fɔndɑ ci hɑlɑɑlɑ. Meire mo ci hɑlɑɑlɑ. À ci cɛsusu. À ci ihinno."
"For that which I do I know not: for not what I would, that do I practise; but what I hate, that I do.","Yɑ di gɑɑ hɛ hinno di yɑ ye ɑ sɛ bu? Awo. À si tɛ. Ammɑ dulum dee, zɑmɑ dulum mɑ hunu tɛrɛ kɑ ngɑ yɑ ci dulum ɑ̀ kɑɑndɑ ɑ sɛ bu hɛ hinno gɑɑ. À nɑ ngɑ di tɛ hɑli meire dɔ dulum mɑ tɛ dulum hɑli ǹ ci mɔsɔ."
"But if what I would not, that I do, I consent unto the law that it is good.",I go bei Ikpɛ dɔ no Moisi fɔndɑ hunu. Ammɑ hɛɛ wɔ bineibɑɑi gɑnɑkɔ no kɑ ɑ̀ nɑ ɑ neerɑ yɑ tɛ tɑm dulum sɛ.
"So now it is no more I that do it, but sin which dwelleth in me.","Hɛ kɑ ɑ go tɛ, ɑ si kɑ ɑ̀ fɑhɑm. À si tɛ mo hɛ kɑ ɑ go bɑɑ. Hɛ kɑ ɑ bine go hungu, ngɑ nɑ ɑ gɑ tɛ."
"For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me, but to do that which is good is not.","De bine ɑ go tɛ hɛ kɑ ɑ si bɑɑ, ɑ go Moisi fɔndɑ tu noyɑ kɑ bei ihinno no."
"For the good which I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I practise.","Ammɑ mɑɑsɑ ɑ̀ mɑnɑ ci hɛɛ yɑ go kɑ ɑ̀ tɛ, ɑmmɑ dulum kɑ ɑ̀ goono ɑ kunɑ nɑ."
"But if what I would not, that I do, it is no more I that do it, but sin which dwelleth in me.","À gɑ bei ihinno si ɑ kunɑ, wɑtom ɑ dulum hɑɑli kunɑ. À bine go bɑɑ ihinno tɛyom ɑmmɑ ɑ sindɑ ɑ̀ tɛyom dɑbɑri."
"I find then the law, that, to me who would do good, evil is present.","Ihinno kɑ ɑ go bɑɑ yɑ ɑ̀ tɛ, ɑ si kɑ ɑ̀ tɛ. Ilɑlɔ kɑ ɑ si bɑɑ, ngɑ no ɑ gɑ tɛ."
For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:,"De ɑ go tɛ hɛ kɑ ɑ si bɑɑ, ɑ̀ mɑnɑ ci hɛɛ yɑ go kɑ ɑ̀ tɛ ɑmmɑ dulum kɑ ɑ̀ goono ɑ kunɑ no."
"but I see a different law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity under the law of sin which is in my members.",Fɔndɑ kɑ ɑ du ɑ gɑɑhɑm kunɑ noyɑ. À gɑ bɑɑ ihinno tɛyom ɑmmɑ ilɑlɔ goono ɑ kunɑ.
Wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me out of the body of this death?,A go fɑɑriŋmɑɑ ndɑ Ikpɛ fɔndɑ ɑ bine kunɑ.
"I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then I of myself with the mind, indeed, serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.",Ammɑ ɑ go di fɔndɔ ŋmɑni fɔ ɑ dɔbei kunɑ kɑ ɑ̀ go tɑngɑm ndɑ hɛ kɑ ɑ fɑhɑm go gɑnɑ. À gɑ kɑ ɑ dɑm mo tɑmtɛrɛ kunɑ dulum fɔndɑ sɛ kɑ ɑ̀ goono ɑ dɔbei kunɑ.
There is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus.,"Kɑito, hɛɛ. Mee yɑ gɑ ɑ kɑɑ gɑɑhɑm kɑ ɑ̀ gɑ kɑɑndɑ bu wɔ kɑmbɛ?"
For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus made me free from the law of sin and of death.,"A go kɑ Ikpɛ sɑɑbu, ɑ̀ go kɑ ɑ kɑɑ i Kpe Yesu Mɛsiyɑ dɔ. À sɛ no fɑhɑm kunɑ ɑ tɑmtɛrɛ Ikpɛ fɔndɑ sɛ, ɑmmɑ dulum hɑɑli dɔ ɑ tɑmtɛrɛ dulum fɔndɑ sɛ."
"For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God, sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:","À sɛ no, mɑɑsɑ ciiti kɑ zeeri si beerem sɛ no kɑ ǹ goono Mɛsiyɑ Yesu kunɑ, nge yom kɑ ǹ go dirɑ ndɑ Biyɑ Hɑlɑɑlɑ, ɑ̀ mɑnɑ ci ndɑ dulum hɑɑli."
"that the ordinance of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.","Biyɑ Hɑlɑɑlɑ fɔndɑ kɑ ɑ̀ gɑ hundi kɑ ɑ̀ si beeni nɑ Mɛsiyɑ Yesu kunɑ, ɑ̀ nɑ ɑ fɑnsɑ dulum fɔndɑ gɑɑ kɑ ɑ̀ go kɑɑndɑ bu."
For they that are after the flesh mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit.,"Hɛ kɑ Moisi fɔndɑ si hini kɑ ɑ̀ tɛ zɑmɑ ɑ̀ sindɑ gɑɑbi dulum hɑɑli dɔ, Ikpɛ nɑ ɑ̀ tɛ.

For the mind of the flesh is death; but the mind of the Spirit is life and peace:,"Ikpɛ nɑ ngɑ di tɛ nɑ domi hɛ kɑ fɔndɑ go tilɑsi kɑ ɑ̀ sɑbɑ, ɑ̀ mɑ tɔ i kunɑ, i yom kɑ i go dirɑ ndɑ Biyɑ Hɑlɑɑlɑ, ɑ̀ mɑnɑ ci ndɑ dulum hɑɑli."
"because the mind of the flesh is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can it be:","Beerem kɑ ngei wɔ go dulum hɑɑli gɑnɑ, dulum hɑɑli hɛ yom bɔm no ǹ lɑsɑbu goono. Ammɑ beerem kɑ ngei wɔ gɑ Biyɑ Hɑlɑɑlɑ gɑnɑ, Biyɑ Hɑlɑɑlɑ hɛ yom bɔm no ǹ lɑsɑbu goono."
and they that are in the flesh cannot please God.,Dulum hɑɑli wɔ lɑsɑbu yɑ ci bu. Biyɑ Hɑlɑɑlɑ mɑ lɑsɑbu yɑ ci hundi ndɑ lɑɑkɑli kɑne.
"But ye are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you. But if any man hath not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.",Dulum hɑɑli lɑsɑbu wɔ ibɛrɛtɛrɛ nɑ Ikpɛ sɛ zɑmɑ ɑ̀ si bɔm yeti gɑndɑ Ikpɛ fɔndɑ sɛ. À si hini kɑ ɑ̀ tɛ mɑ.
"And if Christ is in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the spirit is life because of righteousness.","À sɛ no, beerem kɑ ǹ go dulum hɑɑli gɑnɑ, ǹ si hini kɑ kɑɑni Ikpɛ sɛ."
"But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwelleth in you, he that raised up Christ Jesus from the dead shall give life also to your mortal bodies through his Spirit that dwelleth in you.","Ammɑ wom wɔ, wom si dulum hɑɑli gɑnɑ. Wom go Biyɑ Hɑlɑɑlɑ gɑnɑ zɑ kɑ Ikpɛ Biyɑ goono wom kunɑ ndɑ gɔrɛ. Ammɑ de bɔrɔ fɔ sindɑ Mɛsiyɑ Biyɑ, ɑkpɛ wɔ mɑnɑ ci ɑ̀ ŋmɔne."
"So then, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh:","Ammɑ zɑ kɑ Mɛsiyɑ goono wom kunɑ, wom gɑɑhɑmei bu dulum sɑbu sɛ. Wom biyɑ mo go hunɑ no cɛɑndiyom susu sɑbu sɛ."
"for if ye live after the flesh, ye must die; but if by the Spirit ye put to death the deeds of the body, ye shall live.","Ikpɛ Biyɑ nɑ Yesu tunɑndi bukɔei gɑme. Zɑ kɑ ɑ̀ goono wom kunɑ ndɑ gɔrɛ, ngɑ kɑ ɑ̀ nɑ Mɛsiyɑ Yesu tunɑndi bukɔei gɑme, ɑ̀ kɑɑ wom gɑɑhɑmei kɑ ǹ goono bu bɔm hunɑndi mo. À gɑ ɑ̀ tɛ ndɑ ngɑ Biyɑ kɑ ɑ̀ goono wom kunɑ ndɑ gɔrɛ."
"For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.","Ngɑ di sɛ nyɑizei, i mɑnɑ ci dulum hɑɑli gɑrɔkoni yom hɑli i mɑ hunɑ ndɑ zɑngɑ dulum hɑɑli goono ndɑ."
"For ye received not the spirit of bondage again unto fear; but ye received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.","De wom go hunɑ ndɑ zɑngɑ dulum hɑɑli goono ndɑ, wom goono bu bɔm. Ammɑ de Biyɑ Hɑlɑɑlɑ gɑɑ wom go gɑɑhɑm tɛgbei yom wi, wom kɑɑ hunɑ."
"The Spirit himself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are children of God:","Beerem kulu kɑ Ikpɛ Biyɑ go dɑm fɔndɔ, ngei wɔ Ikpɛ ize yom no."
"and if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified with him.","À mɑnɑ ci tɑmtɛrɛ biyɑ no wom tɑ hɑli wom mɑ goono hɑmburu kunɑ kpɛɛnɛ. Ikpɛ Biyɑ kɑɑtɛrɛ dɑmyom no wom tɑ, wɔ kɑ ɑ̀ gɑɑ i go kuwɑ, Bɑɑbɑ, ɑ Bɑɑbɑ."
For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed to us-ward.,Biyɑ Hɑlɑɑlɑ bumbum ndɑ i biyɑ gɑ tɛ sɛdɑ kɑ i yom wɔ Ikpɛ ize yom no.
For the earnest expectation of the creation waiteth for the revealing of the sons of God.,"Zɑ kɑ i ci Ikpɛ ize yom, i ci tubukɔ yom mo. I ci Ikpɛ tubukɔ yom, tubukɔ yom mefɔ Mɛsiyɑ bɑndɑ. Hɑli kulu i go tɑɑbi mefɔ ndɑ Mɛsiyɑ, i yom mɑ Ikpɛ mɑ i nɑ deizɑ ɑ̀ bɑndɑ."
"For the creation was subjected to vanity, not of its own will, but by reason of him who subjected it, in hope",A diyom gɑɑ mɑɑsɑ lɔkɑci tɑɑbi yom mɑnɑ tɔ sɑsɑbɑndiyom ndɑ deizɑ kɑ yɑ kɑɑ. Deizɑ wɔ Ikpɛ gɑ ɑ̀ kɑɑtɛrɛ i kunɑ.
that the creation itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the liberty of the glory of the children of God.,Tɑkɑhɛ kulu gɑ kɑ Ikpɛ ize yom kɑɑyomtɛrɛ bɑtu ndɑ himmɑ.
For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.,"Tɑkɑhɛ kulu ye gɑndɑ kɔnu cire. À mɑnɑ ye gɑndɑ ndɑ ɑ̀ binebɑɑ, ɑmmɑ Ikpɛ sɑbu sɛ kɑ ɑ̀ nɑ ɑ̀ yeti gɑndɑ."
"And not only so, but ourselves also, who have the first-fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for our adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.",Tɑkɑhɛ kulu go bɛɛjɛ kɑ ngɑ bumbum mo Ikpɛ gɑ ngɑ fɑnsɑ tɑmtɛrɛ kɑ ɑ̀ go kɑɑndɑ fumbi gɑɑ. À gɑ ɑ̀ tɛ no domi ngɑ mɑ huro Ikpɛ ize yom bɔrɔcinitɛrɛ kɑ ɑ̀ gundɑ deizɑ kunɑ.
For in hope were we saved: but hope that is seen is not hope: for who hopeth for that which he seeth?,I go bei tɑkɑhɛ kulu go dure ko tɑɑbi ndɑ hɛizɛnyɛ hɑli hɔ.
"But if we hope for that which we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.","À mɑnɑ ci tɑkɑhɛ hinne. I yom mo, kɑ i gundɑ Biyɑ Hɑlɑɑlɑ hɛijinɑ, i go dure i bumbum kunɑ. I go kootɛrɛ dɑmyom bɑtu wɑtom Ikpɛ gɑ i gɑɑhɑmei fɑnsɑ."
And in like manner the Spirit also helpeth our infirmity: for we know not how to pray as we ought; but the Spirit himself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered;,"Bɛɛjɛ kunɑ nɑ Ikpɛ nɑ i fɑɑbɑ. Bɛɛjɛ bine kɑ bɔrɔ go di ndɑ moo ɑ̀ mɑnɑ ci bɛɛjɛ. Hɛ kɑ bɔrɔ go di ndɑ moo, ifɔ sɛ ɑ̀ mɑ ɑ̀ bɛɛjɛ tɛ kpɛɛnɛ?"
"and he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God.","Ammɑ hɛ kɑ i si di ndɑ moo, de i go kɑ ɑ̀ bɛɛjɛ tɛ i bɑ kɑ ɑ̀ bɑtu no ndɑ suuru."
"And we know that to them that love God all things work together for good, even to them that are called according to his purpose.",Yɑ no Biyɑ Hɑlɑɑlɑ mo go kɑ i gɑɑ i mɔngɔnɛ kunɑ.

"For whom he foreknew, he also foreordained to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren:","Ikpɛ kɑ ɑ̀ gɑ bine yom kunɑ yɑɑse gunɑ, ɑ̀ go Biyɑ Hɑlɑɑlɑ lɑsɑbu mɑ bei. À gɑ kɑ ɑ̀ bei zɑmɑ Biyɑ Hɑlɑɑlɑ go huro hɑlɑɑlɑntɛ yom sɛ ndɑ zɑngɑ Ikpɛ binebɑɑ goono ndɑ."
"and whom he foreordained, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.",Ammɑ i go bei Ikpɛ go hɛ kulu meigu kɑ tɛ bɑrikɑ beerem kɑ ǹ go bɑɑ Ikpɛ sɛ. Nge yom no Ikpɛ cɛɛ mo ndɑ zɑngɑ ɑ̀ miilɑ goono ndɑ.
"What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who is against us?","Beerem kɑ Ikpɛ bei kɑ jisi ɑ̀ nɑ ǹ kɔdɔrɔ ǹ mɑ ci ngɑ Ize himɑi. À nɑ ɑ̀ tɛ no domi Izɑ mɑ ci sintine, nyɑize boobo kunɑ."
"He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not also with him freely give us all things?","Beerem kɑ ɑ̀ kɔdɔrɔ, ɑ̀ nɑ ǹ cɛɛ mo. Beerem kɑ ɑ̀ nɑ ǹ cɛɛ, ɑ̀ nɑ ǹ cɛɑndi susu mɑ. Beerem kɑ ɑ̀ nɑ ǹ cɛɑndi susu, ɑ̀ nɑ ǹ no deizɑ."
Who shall lay anything to the charge of God’s elect? It is God that justifieth;,"Dee ifɔ i mɑ cii kɑ simbɑ ndɑ hɛ yom wɔ? Zɑ kɑ Ikpɛ cɛ i sɛ, mee yɑ gɑɑbɑ ndɑ i yom?"
"who is he that condemneth? It is Christ Jesus that died, yea rather, that was raised from the dead, who is at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.","Cimi no, Ikpɛ mɑnɑ ngɑ bumbum Ize bɑkɑɑ.

"Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or anguish, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?",Mee yɑ gɑ Ikpɛ suubɑntɛ yom beri? Ikpɛ yɑ gɑ cɛɑndi susu.
"Even as it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; We were accounted as sheep for the slaughter.","Mee yɑ gɑ i ciiti kɑ zeeri? Mɛsiyɑ bu. Hɑli yɑ mɑ, Ikpɛ nɑ ɑ̀ tunɑndi mɑ. Ngɑ mo yɑ goono Ikpɛ kɑmbɛŋmɑɑ gɑɑ kɑ hurɑ i sɛ."

"What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, who followed not after righteousness, attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith:","Kpe gɑ ngɑ sendɑ tɔnɑndi nɑ ndɑ wɑɑsi hɑndunyɑ bɔm."""
"but Israel, following after a law of righteousness, did not arrive at that law.","Zɑngɑ Esɑyi jinɑ kɑ cii: ""De Ikpɛ jɑmɑkpɛ mɑnɑ bɑndɑ nɑm i sɛ dɑm, i ye zɑngɑ Sodum wɑngɑrɑ, i kulu mɑ himɑ zɑngɑ Gomorɑ wɑngɑrɑ""."

"For being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and seeking to establish their own, they did not subject themselves to the righteousness of God.","Nyɑizei, hɛ kɑ ɑ bine gɑ bɑɑ ndɑ ŋmɑɑrɛ kɑ ɑ gɑ tɛ Ikpɛ gɑɑ Isirɑilɑ ize yom sɛ, ngɑ yɑ ci ǹ mɑ du fɑɑbɑ."
For Christ is the end of the law unto righteousness to every one that believeth.,A go sɛdɑ ǹ sɛ kɑ ǹ gundɑ himmɑ Ikpɛ sɛ ɑmmɑ ɑ̀ mɑnɑ ci beire bɔm.

"for, Whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.","Ikpɛ Sendɑ cii: ""Bɔrɔ kulu kɑ ɑ̀ go nɑɑne ɑ̀ gɑɑ, ɑ̀ si hɔɔ""."
How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?,"Fɑyɑnkɑ si Yuifu yom ndɑ dimi cindei gɑme. Kpe fɔlɔnku yɑ ci ǹ kulu Kpe, hɑizicikpɛ no beerem kulu sɛ kɑ ǹ go kɑ ɑ̀ cɛɛ."

God did not cast off his people which he foreknew. Or know ye not what the scripture saith of Elijah? how he pleadeth with God against Israel:,"Ammɑ kɑ simbɑ ndɑ Isirɑilɑ ɑ̀ cii: ""Zɑɑri kuyom kulu ɑ nɑ ɑ kɑmbɛ sɛllɛ jɑmɑ gɑɑ, jɑmɑ kɑ ɑ̀ hungu kɑ ɑ gɑnɑ, jɑmɑ kɑ ǹ ci gɔgɔsɛndɔ yom""."

Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.,"""Kpe, ǹ nɑ n ɑndebi yom wi. Ǹ nɑ n gɑrɑndi bɑndɑ tɑndɑ yom zeeri. Hɛɛ hinne yɑ cindi. Ǹ bine go kɑ ɑ hundi ceeci."""

"If it be possible, as much as in you lieth, be at peace with all men.","Wɑ bɑrɑ ndɑ lɑɑkɑli fɔlɔnku cɛrɛ gɑme. Wɑ si bine dɛcɛ hɛ beeri yom bɔm, ɑmmɑ wɑ lɑɑkɑli yeti icɛnɑ yom gɑɑ. Wɑ si wom bɔm gunɑ hɑikusu."
"Avenge not yourselves, beloved, but give place unto the wrath of God: for it is written, Vengeance belongeth unto me; I will recompense, saith the Lord.",Wɑ si ilɑlɔ bɑnɑ ndɑ ilɑlɔ. Wɑ miilɑ hinno tɛ bɔrɔ kulu jine.
"But if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him to drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head.","De ɑ̀ hini kɑ tɛ, zɑngɑ kɑ ɑ̀ mɑ hunu wom dɔ, wɑ gɔrɔ ndɑ bɑɑni wom ndɑ bɔrɔ kulu gɑme."

Let every soul be in subjection to the higher powers: for there is no power but of God; and the powers that be are ordained of God.,"Ngɑ di sɛ, ""de n ŋmɔne ibɛrɛ mɑɑ hɛrɛɛ, n mɑ ɑ̀ no ŋmɑɑri. De ɑ̀ mɑɑ jo, n mɑ ɑ̀ nɑ hɑri domi ngɑ di tɛyom gɑɑ, n gɑ denji gusɑm ɑ̀ bɔm kunɑ noyɑ."
"Therefore he that resisteth the power, withstandeth the ordinance of God: and they that withstand shall receive to themselves judgment.","N mɑ si nɑm ilɑlɔ mɑ gɑɑŋmɑɑ n bɔm, ɑmmɑ n mɑ gɑɑŋmɑɑ ndɑ ihinno tɛyom ilɑlɔ bɔm."
"For rulers are not a terror to the good work, but to the evil. And wouldest thou have no fear of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise from the same:","Bɔrɔ kulu mɑ bɔm yeti gɑndɑ gɑɑbikoni yom sɛ zɑmɑ dɑbɑri si kɑ ɑ̀ mɑnɑ ci Ikpɛ dɔ nɑ ɑ̀ hunu.

"for he is a minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is a minister of God, an avenger for wrath to him that doeth evil.","À sɛ no, bɔrɔ kɑ ɑ̀ go hungu hini, ɑ̀ go hungu Ikpɛ jisiri.

"Wherefore ye must needs be in subjection, not only because of the wrath, but also for conscience’ sake.","Gbei hinno tɛkɔ si hɑmburu gɑɑbikoni yom, ɑmmɑ gbei lɑlɔ tɛkɔ, ɑ̀ hɑmburei. N bɑɑ n mɑ si hɑmburu gɑɑbikoni bɑ? N mɑ ihinno tɛ, n kɑɑ du ɑ̀ gɑɑ sɑɑbuyom."
"For for this cause ye pay tribute also; for they are ministers of God’s service, attending continually upon this very thing.","Gɑɑbikoni wɔ Ikpɛ gbeiteeri nɑ n hɑnfɑni sɛ.

"Owe no man anything, save to love one another: for he that loveth his neighbor hath fulfilled the law.","À sɛ nɑ, wom go jɑngɑli yom bɑnɑ mo domi gɑɑbikoni yom wɔ Ikpɛ gbeiteeri yom no kɑ ǹ nɑ ǹ dɑm ǹ mo gbei ngɑ di tɛ."
"For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not covet, and if there be any other commandment, it is summed up in this word, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.","Wɑ bɑnɑ ǹ kulu sɛ hɛ kɑ ɑ̀ ci ǹ ŋmɔne.

"The night is far spent, and the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light.","Bɑɑkɑsine kunɑ bɔrɔ si ilɑlɔ tɛ gɔrɔkɑsine sɛ. Yɑ di gɑɑ, bɑɑkɑsine wɔ yɑ go Moisi fɔndɑ kulu tɔnɑndi."
"Let us walk becomingly, as in the day; not in revelling and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and jealousy.","Wom mɑ ngɑ di tɛ zɑ kɑ wom nɑ lɔkɑci bei. Lɔkɑci tɔ kɑ i mɑ tunu jiibi, zɑmɑ mɑɑsɑ i fɑɑbɑ mɑɑni i yom gumo kɑ bisɑ sɑɑ kɑ i nɑɑne."
"But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.","Ciini beeri. Mo mɑɑni boyom. Yɑ di gɑɑ, i mɑ kube gbei furu kɑ kɑɑri wɑngu jiine yom zɑɑ."
"But him that is weak in faith receive ye, yet not for decision of scruples.","I mɑ dirɑ ndɑ cimi zɑngɑ zɑɑri, ɑ̀ mɑnɑ ci ndɑ hɑnɑsuɑ ndɑ bɑji hɑm kɑ bugu ndɑ zinɑ ndɑ bɑɑyom futu ndɑ zoji ndɑ cɛnsɛ."
One man hath faith to eat all things: but he that is weak eateth herbs.,Ammɑ wɑ Kpe Yesu Mɛsiyɑ fɑkɑ. Wɑ si sɑɑle dɑm bineibɑɑi gɑɑ kɑ ɑ̀ bɑɑyom futu yom tɛ.
Let not him that eateth set at nought him that eateth not; and let not him that eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath received him.,"Bɔrɔ mɑ kɑ ɑ̀ sindɑ gɑɑbi nɑɑne kunɑ, wom mɑ ɑ̀ tɑ. Wom mɑ si ɑ̀ tɑ kɑ kɑkɔ ndɑ wom lɑsɑbu yom kunɑ."

One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day alike. Let each man be fully assured in his own mind.,"Bɔrɔ di kɑ ɑ̀ go ŋmɑɑ, ɑ̀ mɑ si bɔrɔ kɑ ɑ̀ si ŋmɑɑ fɛntɛ. Bɔrɔ kɑ ɑ̀ si ŋmɑɑ mɑ, ɑ̀ mɑ si bɔrɔ kɑ ɑ̀ gɑ ŋmɑɑ ciiti, domi Ikpɛ nɑ ɑ̀ tɑ."
"He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord: and he that eateth, eateth unto the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, unto the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.","Ni nɑ mee, ni kɑ n gɑ gbeiize ŋmɑni ciiti?

"For none of us liveth to himself, and none dieth to himself.","Bɔrɔ fɔ mo, hɑnu fɔ beeri ɑ̀ dɔ kɑ bisɑ hɑnu fɔ. Afɔ mɑ hɑnu yom kulu ɑ̀ sɛ ɑfɔ nɑ. Bɔrɔ kulu mɑ ngɑ ŋmɔne tɑbɑtɑndi ngɑ bine kunɑ."
"For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; or whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord’s.","Bɔrɔ kɑ ɑ̀ gɑ hɑnu fɑyɑnkɑ, Kpe sɑbu sɛ nɑ ɑ̀ go kɑ ɑ̀ fɑyɑnkɑ.

"For to this end Christ died and lived again, that he might be Lord of both the dead and the living.",I kunɑ bɔrɔ fɔ si kɑ ɑ̀ go hunɑ ngɑ bɔm sɛ. Bɔrɔ si kɑ ɑ̀ bu ngɑ bɔm sɛ.
"But thou, why dost thou judge thy brother? or thou again, why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment-seat of God.","De i go hunɑ, Kpe sɛ no i go hunɑ. De bine i bu no, Kpe sɛ no i bu. Ngɑ di sɛ, de i gɑ hunɑ no, de i go bu no, i yom yɑ Kpe ŋmɔne yom no."
"For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, to me every knee shall bow, And every tongue shall confess to God.","À sɛ no, Mɛsiyɑ bu kɑ ye kɑ hunɑ domi ɑ̀ mɑ ci Kpe bukɔ yom bɔm ndɑ hundikoni yom bɔm."
So then each one of us shall give account of himself to God.,"Ammɑ ni, ifɔ sɛ n gɑ kɑ n nyɑize ciiti? Wɑlɑ ni, ifɔ sɛ n gɑ kɑ n nyɑize fɛntɛ? I kulu kɑɑ cɛ Mɛsiyɑ ciiti kɑrigɑ jine."
"Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge ye this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock in his brother’s way, or an occasion of falling.","Ikpɛ Sendi hɑntumɑntɛ cii: ""A go hunɑ, Kpe cii yɑ di. Cɛnjɛ kulu kɑɑ sɔmbu ɑ jine. Dɛɛnɛ kulu mo gɑ Ikpɛ bɛɛrɑndi."""
"I know, and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean of itself: save that to him who accounteth anything to be unclean, to him it is unclean.","Yɑ di no, i kulu ɑfɔ fɔ, i gɑ i jinde deede Ikpɛ sɛ."
"For if because of meat thy brother is grieved, thou walkest no longer in love. Destroy not with thy meat him for whom Christ died.","Ngɑ di sɛ, i mɑ si cɛrɛ ciiti kpɛɛnɛ, ɑmmɑ wɑ lɑɑkɑli ndɑ wɔne. Wɑ si tɛ hɛ kɑ ɑ̀ mɑ nɑm wom nyɑize mɑ dɛrɛ wɑlɑ ɑ̀ mɑ tɑɑli tɛ."
Let not then your good be evil spoken of:,"A bei, ɑ tɑbɑi mo Kpe Yesu kunɑ hɛ fɔ si kɑ ɑ̀ mɑnɑ ci hɑlɑli. Kɑlɑ de bɔrɔ fɔ kɑ ɑ̀ gɑ lɑsɑbu hɛ fɔ mɑnɑ hɑlɑli, ɑ̀ si ci hɑlɑli bɔrɔ di sɛ."
"for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.","De n nyɑize bine sɑrɑ ndɑ n ŋmɑɑri, n si dirɑ noyɑ ndɑ zɑngɑ bɑɑkɑsine goono ndɑ. N mɑ si bɔrɔ fɔ zeeri ndɑ n ŋmɑɑri, bɔrɔ kɑ ɑ̀ sɛ Mɛsiyɑ bu."
"For he that herein serveth Christ is well-pleasing to God, and approved of men.","Ngɑ di sɛ nɑ, wom mɑ si nɑm ǹ mɑ ihinno kɑ ɑ̀ goono wom gɑɑ sendi yɑmu."
"So then let us follow after things which make for peace, and things whereby we may edify one another.",Ikpɛ kpetɛrɛ wɔ ɑ̀ mɑnɑ ci ŋmɑɑ ndɑ hɑm ɑmmɑ cɛɑndiyom susu ndɑ lɑɑkɑli kɑne ndɑ fɑihã Biyɑ Hɑlɑɑlɑ kunɑ.
Overthrow not for meat’s sake the work of God. All things indeed are clean; howbeit it is evil for that man who eateth with offence.,"Bɔrɔ kɑ ɑ̀ gɑ tɑmtɛrɛ Mɛsiyɑ sɛ zɑngɑ yɑ, ɑkpɛ yɑ kɑɑni Ikpɛ sɛ kɑ sɑbɑ mo iburɑdɑm yom sɛ."
"It is good not to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor to do anything whereby thy brother stumbleth.","Yɑ di gɑɑ, i mɑ gɑnɑ hɛ yom kɑ ǹ go kpei lɑɑkɑli kɑne dɔ ndɑ hɛ yom kɑ ǹ nɑm i mɑ cɛrɛ nɑɑne cini."
"The faith which thou hast, have thou to thyself before God. Happy is he that judgeth not himself in that which he approveth.","I mɑ si Ikpɛ gbei zeeri ŋmɑɑri sɑbu sɛ. Dɑhiri hɛ kulu hɑlɑli. Ndɑ ɑ̀ kulu, ɑ̀ si boori bɔrɔ sɛ sɑɑ kɑ ɑ̀ go ŋmɑɑ, ɑ̀ mɑ ci kɑtiyom hɛ."
"But he that doubteth is condemned if he eat, because he eateth not of faith; and whatsoever is not of faith is sin.","À boori n mɑ si hɑm ŋmɑɑ, n mɑ si dufɛ hɑm, n mɑ si hɛ fɔ kulu tɛ kɑ ɑ̀ mɑ nɑm n nyɑize mɑ kɑti wɑlɑ ɑ̀ mɑ dɛrɛ wɑlɑ ɑ̀ mɑ zɑm gɑɑbi."
"Now we that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves.","N gundɑ nɑɑne bɑ? Ni, hɛ kɑ n gɑ tɑbɑi n mɑ ɑ̀ jisi n bɔm sɛ Ikpɛ jine. Binekɑɑnekpɛ no wɔ kɑ ɑ̀ si ngɑ bɔm ciiti hɛ kɑ ɑ̀ go tɑbɑtɑndi kunɑ."
"Let each one of us please his neighbor for that which is good, unto edifying.","Ammɑ bɔrɔ kɑ ɑ̀ gɑ ŋmɑɑ ndɑ siikɑ, ɑ̀ goono ciiti kɑ zeeri kunɑ domi ɑ̀ si tɛ ndɑ nɑɑne. Hɛ kulu bine kɑ bɔrɔ si kɑ ɑ̀ tɛ ndɑ nɑɑne, dulum no."
"For Christ also pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell upon me.","I yom kɑ i gundɑ gɑɑbi nɑɑne kunɑ, i mɑ mɔngɔntɛ yom mɔngɔnɛ jɛrɛ. I mɑ si tɛ hɛ kɑ ɑ̀ kɑɑni i hinne sɛ."
"For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that through patience and through comfort of the scriptures we might have hope.",I kulu ɑfɔ fɔ mɑ ceeci kɑ kɑɑni i gɔrɔkɑsine sɛ ihinno dɔ nɑɑne ciniyom sɛ.
Now the God of patience and of comfort grant you to be of the same mind one with another according to Christ Jesus:,"Mɛsiyɑ mɑ, ɑ̀ mɑnɑ ceeci kɑ kɑɑni ngɑ bɔm sɛ, kɑlɑ hɛ kɑ Ikpɛ Sendi hɑntumɑntɛ cii: ""Beerem kɑ ǹ go kɑ n woo, ǹ woobi yom kɑm ɑ bɔm""."
that with one accord ye may with one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.,"Hɛ kulu kɑ ǹ hɑntum zɑ dɑm jinɑ, ǹ nɑ ǹ hɑntum nɑ i cɛbɛ sɛ zɑmɑ i mɑ du bɛɛjɛ suuru gɑɑ ndɑ yɑmɑrɑndiyom gɑɑ kɑ i du Ikpɛ Sendɑ kunɑ."
"Wherefore receive ye one another, even as Christ also received you, to the glory of God.","Ikpɛ Suurukpɛ, Yɑmɑrɑndikɔ mo no, ɑ̀ mo wom no lɑɑkɑli fɔlɔnku wom cɛrɛ ndɑ cɛrɛ gɑme Mɛsiyɑ Yesu gɑɑ."
"For I say that Christ hath been made a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, that he might confirm the promises given unto the fathers,","Ndɑ bine fɔ ndɑ mee fɔ wom mɑ Ikpɛ bɛɛrɑndi, i Kpe Yesu Mɛsiyɑ Bɑɑbɑ."
"and that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as it is written, Therefore will I give praise unto thee among the Gentiles, And sing unto thy name.","Ngɑ di sɛ, wɑ cɛrɛ tɑ zɑngɑ Mɛsiyɑ mɑ nɑ i tɑ Ikpɛ deizɑ sɛ."
"And again he saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people.","A go wɔne cii Yesu Mɛsiyɑ yɑ tɛ Yuifu yom gbeiize Ikpɛ cimi sɛ, ɑ̀ mɑ ɑlikɑwɑli kɑ Ikpɛ tɛ cɛɛ yom sɛ tɑbɑtɑndi."

"But I write the more boldly unto you in some measure, as putting you again in remembrance, because of the grace that was given me of God,","Ikpɛ Bɛɛjɛkpɛ, ɑ̀ mɑ wom tɔnɑndi ndɑ binekɑɑne kulu ndɑ lɑɑkɑli kɑni nɑɑne kunɑ, wom mɑ du kɑ bɑ bɛɛjɛ kunɑ ndɑ Biyɑ Hɑlɑɑlɑ dɑbɑri."

Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles?,"Wom yɑ Mɛsiyɑ gɑɑhɑm no. Wom yɑ ɑ̀ dɔbu yom no, bɔrɔ kulu ndɑ ɑ̀ dɔ."

"Now I would have you all speak with tongues, but rather that ye should prophesy: and greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive edifying.","Ammɑ bɔrɔ cɛ kɑ ɑ̀ go ɑndebitɛrɛ tɛ, iburɑdɑm yom sɛ no ɑ̀ go sendi kɑ ǹ nɑɑne cini.

"But now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, unless I speak to you either by way of revelation, or of knowledge, or of prophesying, or of teaching?","Bɔrɔ kɑ ɑ̀ gɑ sendi ndɑ cinɛ ŋmɑni, ɑ̀ bɔm nɑɑne no ɑ̀ go cini.

"There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and no kind is without signification.","De wɑngu hɛrɛɛ jinde diibi, mee yɑ wɑngu sɔlu?"
"If then I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be to him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh will be a barbarian unto me.","Yɑ no wom mo. De wom go sendi ndɑ cinɛ kɑ beerem si fɑhɑm, mɛtɛ bɔrɔ tɛ kɑ fɑhɑm ndɑ hɛ kɑ wom go cii? Kɔnu sɛ no wom go sendi."

Wherefore let him that speaketh in a tongue pray that he may interpret.,"Ngɑ di sɛ, de ɑ si fɑhɑm ndɑ cinɛ ɑ himɑ zɑngɑ ɑnne, bɔrɔ kɑ ɑ̀ go sendi sɛ. Ngɑ mo kɑ ɑ̀ go sendi, ɑnne no ɑ̀ himɑ ɑ sɛ."
"For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful.","Yɑ no wom mo. Zɑ kɑ wom go guuri Biyɑ Hɑlɑɑlɑ noyom ndɑ himmɑ, wɑ ceeci ndɑ bɑyom wɔ kɑ yom go Mɛsiyɑ mɑrgɑ nɑɑne cini."
"What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.","À sɛ no bɔrɔ kɑ ɑ̀ gɑ sendi ndɑ cinɛ ŋmɑni, ɑ̀ mɑ Ikpɛ ŋmɑɑrɛ ngɑ mɑ du kɑ cinɛ yɑɑrɑ."
"Else if thou bless with the spirit, how shall he that filleth the place of the unlearned say the Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he knoweth not what thou sayest?","De ɑ go kɑ ɑduwɑ tɛ ndɑ cinɛ ŋmɑni, ɑ biyɑ yɑ go kɑ ɑduwɑ tɛ ɑmmɑ ɑ fɑhɑm sindɑ bɑrikɑ."
"For thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not edified.",Yɑ di gɑɑ mɛtɛ ɑ tɛ? Biyɑ kunɑ no ɑ gɑ ɑduwɑ tɛ ɑmmɑ ɑ gɑ ɑduwɑ tɛ ndɑ ɑ fɑhɑm mo. A kɑɑ betu tɛ Biyɑ kunɑ. A kɑɑ betu tɛ mo ndɑ fɑhɑm.

"howbeit in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that I might instruct others also, than ten thousand words in a tongue.","Ni, cimi no n go sɑɑbu ihinno ɑmmɑ hɑngɑ dɑmkɔ nɑɑne si cini."

"Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to the unbelieving: but prophesying is for a sign, not to the unbelieving, but to them that believe.","Nyɑizei, wom lɑsɑbu yom kunɑ, wɑ si tɛ koo cɛnɑ yom.

"If therefore the whole church be assembled together and all speak with tongues, and there come in men unlearned or unbelieving, will they not say that ye are mad?","""Moisi fɔndɑ kunɑ ǹ nɑ ɑ̀ hɑntum kɑ Ikpɛ cii: A kɑɑ sendi jɑmɑ wɔ sɛ ndɑ cinɛ ŋmɑni ŋmɑni yom A kɑɑ sendi ǹ sɛ yo yom mee gɑɑ.

"But if all prophesy, and there come in one unbelieving or unlearned, he is reproved by all, he is judged by all;","Yɑ di gɑɑ, cinɛ ŋmɑni ŋmɑni yɑ ɑlɑmu nɑ. À nɑ ci nɑɑnekɔ yom sɛ ɑmmɑ zɑm kɑ nɑɑnekɔ yom sɛ. Andebitɛrɛ mo ɑ̀ mɑnɑ ci zɑm kɑ nɑɑnekɔ yom sɛ ɑmmɑ nɑɑnekɔ yom sɛ."

"If any man speaketh in a tongue, let it be by two, or at the most three, and that in turn; and let one interpret:","À gɑɑ no, ɑ̀ bine kunɑ gundu yom kɑɑtɛrɛ. Bine ɑ̀ tɔ ɑ̀ mɑ jɛndɛbiri kɑ Ikpɛ bɛɛrɑndi. À kɑɑ cii: Hɑlɑbɑdɑ, Ikpɛ goono wom bɑndɑ."

For I delivered unto you first of all that which also I received: that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;,"Nyɑizei, ɑ go wom hɔngɑndi Bɑɑru Hinno kɑ ɑ nɑ wom wɑɑzu ndɑ. Wom nɑ ɑ̀ tɑ. Bɑɑru Hinno kunɑ no wom go cɛ."

Howbeit the son by the handmaid is born after the flesh; but the son by the freewoman is born through promise.,"Ikpɛ Sendi hɑntumɑntɛ cii Abulɛmɑ du koo hɑibɔrɔ hinkɑ. Afɔ kɔngɔ gɑɑ no, ǹ nɑ ɑ̀ hɛi, ɑfɔ mɑ bɔrɔcini weibɔrɔ gɑɑ."

"But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit, so also it is now.","Ammɑ nyɑizei, i yom yɑ ɑlikɑwɑli ize yom no zɑngɑ Isɑɑkɑ."

"And thus, having patiently endured, he obtained the promise.","A cii: ""Dɑhiri no, ɑ kɑɑ bɑrikɑ dɑm n gɑɑ. A kɑɑ nɑm n bɑndɑ mo mɑ bɑ."""

"For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of God Most High, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him,","Nungu di no Yesu huro i sɛ jine kɑ fɔndɔ feeri i sɛ zɑmɑ ɑ̀ ci Gɑrɑndikɔ Beeri, beeniyom si zɑngɑ Mɛkizɑdɛkɑ gɑrɑndikɔtɛrɛ cine."
"to whom also Abraham divided a tenth part of all (being first, by interpretation, King of righteousness, and then also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;","Mɛkizɑdɛkɑ wɔ, Sɑlim wɑngɑrɑ kpe nɑ.

"without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like unto the Son of God), abideth a priest continually.","Cɔfɔ Abulɛmɑ nɑ ɑ̀ no zɑkɑ hɛ kulu kɑ ɑ̀ du wɑngu di dɔ.

"Now consider how great this man was, unto whom Abraham, the patriarch, gave a tenth out of the chief spoils.","Mɛkizɑdɛkɑ sindɑ bɑɑbɑ. À sindɑ nyɑ. À sindɑ cɛɛ kɑ cɛɛ yom. À sindɑ hɑnu kɑ ɑ̀ sinti, ɑ̀ hundi sindɑ mee. À himɑ nɑ zɑngɑ Ikpɛ Ize. Mɛkizɑdɛkɑ wɔ gɔrɔ nɑ gɑrɑndikɔ gɔrɛ, beeniyom si."
"And they indeed of the sons of Levi that receive the priest’s office have commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though these have come out of the loins of Abraham:","Gunɑ, bɔrɔ kpɛ bɛɛrɛ wɔ kɑ ɑ̀ sɛ Abulɛmɑ kɑ ɑ̀ ci cɛɛ zeenu nɑ zɑkɑ kɑɑ hɛ yom bɔm kɑ ɑ̀ nɑ wɑngu ŋmɑɑ."
"but he whose genealogy is not counted from them hath taken tithes of Abraham, and hath blessed him that hath the promises.","Lefi bɑndɑ yom kɑ ǹ gundɑ gɑrɑndikɔtɛrɛ du fɔndɔ kɑ zɑkɑ tɑ beerem gɑɑ Moisi fɔndɑ bɔm. Ǹ go kɑ ɑ̀ tɑ beerem dɔ kɑ ci ǹ nyɑize yom, bɑ kɑ Abulɛmɑ bɑndɑ yom no."
But without any dispute the less is blessed of the better.,"Ammɑ Mɛkizɑdɛkɑ kɑ ɑ̀ mɑnɑ ci Lefi bɑndɑ, ɑ̀ nɑ zɑkɑ tɑ Abulɛmɑ gɑɑ. À nɑ bɑrikɑ dɑm bɔrɔ di gɑɑ, bɔrɔ kɑ ɑ̀ sɛ Ikpɛ nɑ ɑlikɑwɑli yom tɛ."
"And here men that die receive tithes; but there one, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.","Kɑkɔ si, bɔrɔ kɑ ɑ̀ ci icɛnɑ du bɑrikɑ bɔrɔ kɑ ɑ̀ beeri ndɑ, ɑ̀ dɔ."
"And, so to say, through Abraham even Levi, who receiveth tithes, hath paid tithes;","Nee wɔ beerem kɑ ǹ bu go zɑkɑ yom tɑ iburɑdɑm yom gɑɑ. Ammɑ yɔngɔ bɔrɔ kɑ ɑ̀ gɑ zɑkɑ tɑ, Ikpɛ Sendɑ tɛ sɛdɑ kɑ ɑkpɛ go hunɑ."

"Now if there was perfection through the Levitical priesthood (for under it hath the people received the law), what further need was there that another priest should arise after the order of Melchizedek, and not be reckoned after the order of Aaron?","Sɑɑ kɑ Mɛkizɑdɛkɑ nɑ Abulɛmɑ kube, ǹ mɑnɑ Lefi hɛi jinɑ. À goono ngɑ cɛɛ cɛntɛ cire."
"For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.","Moisi fɔndɑ kɑ Ikpɛ nɑ jɑmɑ no, Lefi gɑrɑndikɔtɛrɛ bɔm no ɑ̀ goono.

For it is evident that our Lord hath sprung out of Judah; as to which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priests.,"Kɑ simbɑ bɔrɔ di kɑ ɑ̀ gɑɑ ǹ go hɛ yom wɔ cii, dimi ŋmɑni fɔ bɔrɔ no. Dimi wɔ kunɑ bɑ bɔrɔ fɔ mɑnɑ hini kɑ mɑɑni gɑrɑndi bɑndɑ tɑndɑ dɔ kɑ gbei tɛ."
"And what we say is yet more abundantly evident, if after the likeness of Melchizedek there ariseth another priest,",Bɔrɔ kulu go bei kɑ Yudɑ gɑɑ no i Kpe hunu. Yudɑ dimi wɔ bɔm Moisi mɑnɑ hɛ fɔ kulu cii kɑ simbɑ ndɑ gɑrɑndikɔtɛrɛ.
"who hath been made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life:","Hɛ kɑ i go bei cɑu cɑu kɑ tɔntɔnu neyɑ. Sɑɑ kɑ gɑrɑndikɔ ŋmɑni fɔ mɑ tunu, ɑ̀ himɑ Mɛkizɑdɛkɑ cine."
"for it is witnessed of him, Thou art a priest for ever After the order of Melchizedek.","Ngɑ wɔ, Ikpɛ mɑnɑ ɑ̀ gɔrɛndi ndɑ zɑngɑ iburɑdɑm yom meire goono ndɑ. À nɑ ɑ̀ gɔrɛndi hundi kɑ ɑ̀ si hini kɑ beeni dɑbɑri bɔm."
For there is a disannulling of a foregoing commandment because of its weakness and unprofitableness,"Ikpɛ sɛdɑ ɑ̀ sɛ kɑ cii: ""Ni, n bo ci gɑrɑndikɔ, beeniyom si, zɑngɑ Mɛkizɑdɛkɑ gɑrɑndikɔtɛrɛ cine""."

And inasmuch as it is not without the taking of an oath,"Fɔndɑ mɑnɑ kɑɑndɑ hɛ fɔlɔnku tɔyom dɔ. Ikpɛ kɑɑndɑ bɛɛjɛ hinno, bɛɛjɛ kɑ ɑ̀ go nɑm i go mɑɑni Ikpɛ gɑɑ."
"(for they indeed have been made priests without an oath; but he with an oath by him that saith of him, The Lord sware and will not repent himself, Thou art a priest for ever);",Ikpɛ nɑ ɑ̀ tɛ mɑ ndɑ zeyom.
by so much also hath Jesus become the surety of a better covenant.,"Lefi bɑndɑ yom mo mɑnɑ tɛ gɑrɑndikɔ yom zeyom bɔm. Ammɑ Yesu ci gɑrɑndikɔ Ikpɛ zeyom bɔm. Kpe cii ɑ̀ sɛ: ""Kpe ze, ɑ̀ bine si tunɑndi pɑi. Ni, n bɑ ci Gɑrɑndikɔ sɑɑ kulu, beeniyom si, zɑngɑ Mɛkizɑdɛkɑ gɑrɑndikɔtɛrɛ cine."""
"And they indeed have been made priests many in number, because that by death they are hindered from continuing:","Zeyom di bɔm no Yesu ci zɑngɑ tɔlimɛ ɑlikɑwɑli teji sɛ, ɑlikɑwɑli kɑ ɑ̀ boori kɑ bisɑ izeenɑ."
"but he, because he abideth for ever, hath his priesthood unchangeable.","Lefi dimi gɑrɑndikɔ yom di bine bɑ bututu, zɑmɑ bu nɑ ǹ gɑnji."
"Wherefore also he is able to save to the uttermost them that draw near unto God through him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.","Ammɑ Yesu wɔ, zɑmɑ kɑ ɑ̀ bo goono beeniyom si sɛ, ɑ̀ gundɑ gɑrɑndikɔtɛrɛ kɑ ɑ̀ si ye bɔrɔ ŋmɑni fɔ dɔ."
"For such a high priest became us, holy, guileless, undefiled, separated from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;","Ngɑ di sɛ mo no, ɑ̀ hini kɑ beerem kɑ ǹ gɑ mɑɑni Ikpɛ gɑɑ ngɑ dɔ, ɑ̀ hini kɑ ǹ no fɑɑbɑ tɔnɑntɛ zɑ kɑ ɑ̀ gɑ hunɑ ko huro ǹ sɛ Ikpɛ dɔ."
"who needeth not daily, like those high priests, to offer up sacrifices, first for his own sins, and then for the sins of the people: for this he did once for all, when he offered up himself.","À sɑbɑ ɑ̀ sɛ i mɑ du gɑrɑndikɔ beeri fɔ zɑngɑ ngɑ, hɑlɑɑlɑ, bɑɑnikom, ziibi si. Ikpɛ mɑnɑ ɑ̀ lɑsɑbu dulumkoni yom kunɑ kɑ kpeindɑ hɑli bɛɛnɛ sɑmɑu."
"For the law appointeth men high priests, having infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was after the law, appointeth a Son, perfected for evermore.","À mɑnɑ ci zɑngɑ gɑrɑndikɔ beeri ŋmɑni yom.

"Now in the things which we are saying the chief point is this: We have such a high priest, who sat down on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,","Moisi fɔndɑ go gɑrɑndikɔ beeri yom dɑm, beerem kɑ ǹ si hini ngei bɔm.

For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is necessary that this high priest also have somewhat to offer.,"Ngɑ yɑ go gɑrɑndikɔtɛrɛ gbei tɛ Nungu Hɑlɑɑlɑ kunɑ kɑ ɑ̀ ci kuuru bukɑ, cimi ŋmɔne. Bukɑ di Kpe bumbum yɑ nɑ ɑ̀ sinji, ɑ̀ mɑnɑ ci iburɑdɑm."
"Now if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, seeing there are those who offer the gifts according to the law;",Ikpɛ nɑ gɑrɑndikɔ beeri kulu dɑm nɑ ɑ̀ mɑ sɑrɑɑ yom ndɑ gɑrɑndi hɛ yom cɛbɛ Ikpɛ sɛ. Ngɑ di sɛ ɑ̀ tilɑsi i gɑrɑndikɔ beeri mɑ mɑ gundɑ hɛ fɔ kɑ cɛbɛ.

"For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel After those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, And on their heart also will I write them: And I will be to them a God, And they shall be to me a people:","À nɑ ci zɑngɑ ɑlikɑwɑli kɑ ɑ hɔ ndɑ ǹ cɛɛ yom, hɑnu kɑ ɑ nɑ ǹ kɑmbɛ yom dii kɑ ǹ kɑɑ Eziputu lɑɑbu di.

"And for this cause he is the mediator of a new covenant, that a death having taken place for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first covenant, they that have been called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.","De ngɑ di ci cimi, hɑli yɑ mɑ Mɛsiyɑ kuri go wom bine kunɑ sendi hinnɑndi gbei bukɔ yom gɑɑ wom mɑ du kɑ tɑmtɛrɛ Ikpɛ Hundikpɛ sɛ.

"For when every commandment had been spoken by Moses unto all the people according to the law, he took the blood of the calves and the goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,",À sɛ nɑ bɑ ɑlikɑwɑli sintine mo ǹ mɑnɑ ɑ̀ sinji kɑlɑ de ǹ nɑ ɑ̀ tɛ ndɑ kuri.

It was necessary therefore that the copies of the things in the heavens should be cleansed with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.,"Bɔrɔ hini kɑ cii kɑ ǹ go hɛ yom bɑyom hinnɑndi ndɑ kuri Moisi fɔndɑ bɔm. Bine, de kuri mɑnɑ dooru mo, yɑɑfɑ si."
"For Christ entered not into a holy place made with hands, like in pattern to the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear before the face of God for us:","Ngɑ di sɛ ɑ̀ tilɑsi bɛɛnɛ hɛ yom himɑi yom mɑ du hinnɑndiyom zɑngɑ yɑ di.

else must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once at the end of the ages hath he been manifested to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.,Ammɑ ɑ̀ mɑnɑ huro mo hɑli ɑ̀ mɑ ngɑ bɔm sɑrɑɑ ce boobo zɑngɑ gɑrɑndikɔ beeri cini hurɑ Nungu Hɑlɑɑlɑ yom ŋmɔne Hɑlɑɑlɑ dɔ kɑ memunu ŋmɑni ŋmɑni kuri sɑrɑɑ jiiri kɑ kɑɑ jiiri.
"And inasmuch as it is appointed unto men once to die, and after this cometh judgment;",De yɑ di no dom tilɑsi Mɛsiyɑ mɑ tɑɑbi ce boobo zɑ hɑndunyɑ sinjiyom. Ammɑ mɑɑsɑ zɑmɑni beeniyom mee gɑɑ ɑ̀ kɑɑtɛrɛ kɑ dulum kɑɑ ce fɔ ɑ̀ bɔm gɑrɑndiyom gɑɑ.
"so Christ also, having been once offered to bear the sins of many, shall appear a second time, apart from sin, to them that wait for him, unto salvation.","Bine, zɑngɑ ǹ jisi iburɑdɑm yom sɛ, ǹ mɑ bu ce fɔlɔnku, ɑ̀ bɑndɑ ciiti mɑ kɑɑ."
"For the law having a shadow of the good things to come, not the very image of the things, can never with the same sacrifices year by year, which they offer continually, make perfect them that draw nigh.","Yɑ nɑ Mɛsiyɑ mo nɑ ngɑ bɔm no ce fɔ ɑ̀ mɑ bɔrɔ boobo dulum yom jɛrɛ.

But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance made of sins year by year.,"De ɑ̀ nɑ ci yɑ, dom ǹ cɛ ndɑ gɑrɑndi tɛyom. Beerem kɑ ǹ go kɑ Ikpɛ bɛɛrɑndi, zɑ kɑ ǹ nɑ ǹ hinnɑndi ce fɔ pɑp, dom ǹ si bo hɔngɔ ndɑ ngei dulum yom kpɛɛnɛ. À nɑ ci cimi no bɑ?"
For it is impossible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins.,Ammɑ gɑrɑndi hɛ nge yom di kunɑ ǹ bo hɔngɔ dulum yom jiiri kɑ kɑɑ jiiri kulu.
"Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, But a body didst thou prepare for me;",Yɑ no hɑuyeji yom kuri ndɑ hɑncine kuri si hini kɑ dulum yom kɑɑ.
In whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hadst no pleasure:,"À sɛ no, kɑ Mɛsiyɑ kɑɑ hɑndunyɑ ɑ̀ cii: ""N si bɑɑ gɑrɑndi hɛ, n si bɑɑ sɑrɑɑ. Ammɑ n nɑ gɑɑhɑm sɔlu ɑ sɛ."

"Saying above, Sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure therein (the which are offered according to the law),","Bine, hɛɛ mo ɑ cii: E Ikpɛ, ɑ go kɑɑ kɑ n binebɑɑ tɛ zɑngɑ ǹ hɑntum ɑ bɔm n tirɑ kunkunɑntɛ kunɑ."""

"And the Holy Spirit also beareth witness to us; for after he hath said,","Sɑrɑɑ fɔlɔnku dɔ no ɑ̀ nɑ beerem tɔɑndi, tɔɑndiyom duumiɑntɛ, ngei kɑ Ikpɛ nɑ ǹ hɑlɑɑlɑndi."
"This is the covenant that I will make with them After those days, saith the Lord: I will put my laws on their heart, And upon their mind also will I write them; then saith he,","Ngɑ di no, Biyɑ Hɑlɑɑlɑ mo go tɛ sɛdɑ i sɛ ngɑ di bɔm. Sintine ɑ̀ cii:"
And their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.,"""Wɔne yɑ ci ɑlikɑwɑli kɑ ɑ kɑɑ tɛ ǹ sɛ hɑnu nge yom di bɑndɑ. Kpe cii yɑ di. A gɑ ɑ fɔndɔ yom dɑm ǹ bine yom kunɑ. A gɑ ǹ jeeri mɑ ǹ lɑsɑbu yom gɑɑ."""

"For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more a sacrifice for sins,","I mɑ si Mɛsiyɑ jɑmɑ meiguyom mure zɑngɑ bɔrɔ fɔ yom dɔnɑ kɑ cini tɛ. Ammɑ i mɑ cɛrɛ no himmɑ, hɑli yɑ mo mɑɑsɑ kɑ wom gɑ di Kpe Hɑnu go mɑɑni mɑ."

"of how much sorer punishment, think ye, shall he be judged worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant wherewith he was sanctified an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace?","Bɔrɔ kɑ ɑ̀ nɑ Moisi fɔndɑ dɑɑrum, ɑ̀ mɑ bu sisibi si, bɔrɔ hinkɑ wɑlɑ bɔrɔ hinzɑ sɛdɑ bɔm."

"By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and he was not found, because God translated him: for he hath had witness borne to him that before his translation he had been well-pleasing unto God:","Nɑɑne gɑɑ no Abɛli nɑ gɑrɑndi tɛ Ikpɛ sɛ, gɑrɑndi kɑ ɑ̀ bisɑ Kɑinu ŋmɔne.

and in your knowledge self-control; and in your self-control patience; and in your patience godliness;,"Ngɑ di bumbum sɛ mo no, wom kulu wɑ himmɑ dɑm kɑ booriyom tɔntɔnu wom nɑɑne gɑɑ, booriyom gɑɑ mo beire."
and in your godliness brotherly kindness; and in your brotherly kindness love.,"Beire gɑɑ mo wɑ bɔm hiniyom tɔntɔnu. Bɔm hiniyom gɑɑ mo, wɑ suuru tɔntɔnu. Suuru gɑɑ mo, wɑ Ikpɛ gɑnɑyom tɔntɔnu."
"For if these things are yours and abound, they make you to be not idle nor unfruitful unto the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.","Ikpɛ gɑnɑyom gɑɑ mo, wɑ nyɑize bɑɑkɑsine tɔntɔnu. Nyɑize bɑɑkɑsine gɑɑ mo wɑ bɑɑkɑsine tɔntɔnu."
"For he that lacketh these things is blind, seeing only what is near, having forgotten the cleansing from his old sins.",À himɑ hɛ nge yom di mɑ goono wom gɑɑ kɑ bɑ kɑ tɔntɔnu mo zɑmɑ ǹ nɑm wom mɑ si gɔrɔ kɔnu. Ǹ nɑm wom mɑ si zɑm bɑrikɑ mɑ i Kpe Yesu Mɛsiyɑ beiyom kunɑ.
"Wherefore, brethren, give the more diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never stumble:","Bɔrɔ kɑ hɛ nge yom di si ɑ̀ gɑɑ, diyom dumbɔkpɛ no zɑngɑ dɑnɑm no. À dinigɑ kɑ Ikpɛ nɑ ngɑ hinnɑndi ngɑ dom dulum yom gɑɑ."
for thus shall be richly supplied unto you the entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.,"À sɛ no, nyɑizei, wɑ himmɑ dɑm kɑ bei ndɑ cimi Ikpɛ nɑ wom cɛɛ, ɑ̀ nɑ wom suubɑ. Ngɑ di tɛyom gɑɑ, wom si kɑti pɑi."
"Wherefore I shall be ready always to put you in remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and are established in the truth which is with you.","Yɑ no Ikpɛ kɑɑ tu wom sɛ wom mɑ huro ndɑ bɛɛrɛ i Kpe Yesu Mɛsiyɑ kɑ ɑ̀ ci Fɑɑbɑkɔ, ɑ̀ kpetɛrɛ kɑ ɑ̀ sindɑ beeniyom kunɑ."
"And I think it right, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance;","À sɛ no, ɑ go wetere kɑ wom hɔngɑndi hɛ nge yom di sɑɑ kulu. Wom go hɛ nge yom di bei zɑ kɑ Ikpɛ nɑ wom sinji kɑ boori cimi kunɑ."
"knowing that the putting off of my tabernacle cometh swiftly, even as our Lord Jesus Christ signified unto me.","Oò, ɑ go lɑsɑbu ɑ̀ sɑbɑ sɑɑ kulu kɑ ɑ goono gɑɑhɑm kunɑ kɑ ɑ̀ ci zɑngɑ kuuru bukɑ, yɑ wom hɔngɑndi hɛ nge yom di."
"Yea, I will give diligence that at every time ye may be able after my decease to call these things to remembrance.",A bei kɑ ɑ buyom mɑɑni kɑ yɑ fee ndɑ kuuru bukɑ wɔ zɑngɑ i Kpe Yesu Mɛsiyɑ nɑ ɑ cɛbɛ.
"For we did not follow cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty.","Ammɑ ɑ go kɑ ɑ̀ wetere kulu tɛ hɑli bɑ ɑ dirɑ bɑndɑ kɑ ɑ̀ ci bu, wom mo hɔngɔ hɛ nge yom di lɔkɑci kulu."
"For he received from God the Father honor and glory, when there was borne such a voice to him by the Majestic Glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased:","Hɛ kɑ sɛ ɑ gɑ kɑ nge yom di cii yɑ ci kɑ i mɑnɑ jendi cɛmbɛrɛkpɛ yom gɑnɑ.

"and this voice we ourselves heard borne out of heaven, when we were with him in the holy mount.","À du bɛɛrɛ ndɑ deizɑ Bɑɑbɑ Ikpɛ dɔ, sɑɑ kɑ jinde fɔ hunu zɑ deizɑ kɑ ɑ̀ bisɑ deizɑ kulu dɔ kɑ sendi ɑ̀ bɔm. À cii: Bɔrɔ wɔne yɑ ci ɑ Ize Binegɑnji, kɑ ɑ̀ gɑɑ ɑ du binekɑɑne."
"And we have the word of prophecy made more sure; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day-star arise in your hearts:","I yom mɑ, i mɑɑ jinde ngɑ di kɑ ɑ̀ hunu zɑ bɛɛnɛ sɑɑ kɑ i goono Yesu bɑndɑ tɑndi kuku hɑlɑɑlɑ bɔm."

"For no prophecy ever came by the will of man: but men spake from God, being moved by the Holy Spirit.","Wom mɑ wɔne bei mɑ jinɑ, Ikpɛ Sendi kunɑ ɑndebitɛrɛ kulu sindɑ fɑsɑliyom bɔrɔ fɑhɑm bɔm."
"But there arose false prophets also among the people, as among you also there shall be false teachers, who shall privily bring in destructive heresies, denying even the Master that bought them, bringing upon themselves swift destruction.","Andebitɛrɛ mɑnɑ hunu bɔrɔ fɔ binebɑɑ dɔ, bɑ ce fɔ.

And many shall follow their lascivious doings; by reason of whom the way of the truth shall be evil spoken of.,"Andebi tɑngɑri tɑngɑri yom goono jɑmɑ di kunɑ dɑm.

"And in covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you: whose sentence now from of old lingereth not, and their destruction slumbereth not.","Bɔrɔ boobo bine gɑ ǹ gɑnɑ ǹ hɑlɑciyom kunɑ. Ǹ sɑbu sɛ no, ǹ go cimi fɔndɔ di sendi yɑmu."
"For if God spared not angels when they sinned, but cast them down to hell, and committed them to pits of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment;","Hɛ bɑɑyom futu gɑɑ no cooɑndikɔ tɑngɑri tɑngɑri yom kɑɑ wom fɑfɑgu ndɑ ngei sendi zɑmbɑkpɛ yom.

"and spared not the ancient world, but preserved Noah with seven others, a preacher of righteousness, when he brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly;","Ikpɛ mɑnɑ ngɑ dɔntɔneize yom kɑ ǹ nɑ dulum tɛ bɑkɑɑ, ɑmmɑ ɑ̀ nɑ ǹ cetu ciyomɑ guusu guusɔ kunɑ.

"and turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes condemned them with an overthrow, having made them an example unto those that should live ungodly;","Bine, Ikpɛ mɑnɑ dɑm jinɑ hɑndunyɑ bɑkɑɑ kɑlɑ Nowe kɑ ɑ̀ ci cɛɑndiyom susu fɛɛkɔ.

"(for that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their lawless deeds):",À nɑ Lotu kɑ ɑ̀ ci bɔrɔ cɛɑntɛ susu kɑɑ. Lotu bine sɑrɑ ndɑ ilɑlɔ tɛkɔ yom hɑwizetɛrɛ gɔrɛ.
"the Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptation, and to keep the unrighteous under punishment unto the day of judgment;","Bɔrɔ cɛɑntɛ susu wɔ, ɑ̀ nɑ ngɑ gɔrɛ tɛ ǹ gɑme.

"but chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of defilement, and despise dominion. Daring, self-willed, they tremble not to rail at dignities:","Zɑngɑ Kpe nɑ ngɑ di tɛ Lotu sɛ, ɑ̀ ŋmɑɑni kɑ ngɑ gɑnɑkɔ yom kɑɑ tɑɑbi kunɑ.

"whereas angels, though greater in might and power, bring not a railing judgment against them before the Lord.","Yɑ mɑ Ikpɛ kɑɑ tɛ beerem sɛ kɑ ǹ gɑ kɑ ngei bineibɑɑi gɑnɑ kɑ bɑɑ hɛ kɑ ɑ̀ gɑ kɑ ǹ bine ziibɑndi.

"But these, as creatures without reason, born mere animals to be taken and destroyed, railing in matters whereof they are ignorant, shall in their destroying surely be destroyed,",Bɑ Ikpɛ dɔntɔneize yom kɑ ǹ gundɑ gɑɑbi ndɑ dɑbɑri kɑ bisei ǹ si kɑɑndɑ woobi ciiti ǹ bɔm Kpe jine.

"These are springs without water, and mists driven by a storm; for whom the blackness of darkness hath been reserved.","Ammɑ fɑrikɑ fɔ nɑ Bɑlɑm dulum bɔgu ɑ̀ bɔm. Fɑrikɑ kɑ ɑ̀ si sendi, sendi ɑ̀ sɛ ndɑ iburɑdɑm jinde. À nɑ ɑndebi di hɔllɔkomtɛrɛ jɛ."
"For, uttering great swelling words of vanity, they entice in the lusts of the flesh, by lasciviousness, those who are just escaping from them that live in error;","Bɔrɔ nge yom di bɑrɑ no zɑngɑ tondi guusu fɔci yom kɑ ǹ sindɑ hɑri, buru yom kɑ hɑri hɛo feeni.

"For if, after they have escaped the defilements of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein and overcome, the last state is become worse with them than the first.","Ǹ gɑ bɔrɔcinitɛrɛ ɑlikɑwɑli tɛ ǹ sɛ bɑ kɑ ngei bumbum gɑ ci fumbi tɑmtɛrɛ kunɑ.

"For it were better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after knowing it, to turn back from the holy commandment delivered unto them.","Ǹ kɔmɑ hɑndunyɑ ziibi yom gɑɑ Kpe Yesu Mɛsiyɑ kɑ ɑ̀ ci Fɑɑbɑkɔ ɑ̀ beiyom dɔ.

"It has happened unto them according to the true proverb, The dog turning to his own vomit again, and the sow that had washed to wallowing in the mire.","Ǹ mɑ si cɛyom susu fɔndɔ bei ɑ̀ bisɑ, de sɑɑ kɑ ǹ nɑ ɑ̀ bei, ɑ̀ bɑndɑ ǹ mɑ bɑndɑ bɛrɛ ɑ̀ gɑɑ ndɑ meire hɑlɑɑlɑ kɑ ǹ jinɑ kɑ no ǹ sɛ."
"This is now, beloved, the second epistle that I write unto you; and in both of them I stir up your sincere mind by putting you in remembrance;","Hɛ kɑ yɑɑse wɔne gɑ cii, dɑhiri no ɑ̀ tɔ ǹ gɑɑ.

"that ye should remember the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and the commandment of the Lord and Saviour through your apostles:","A binebɑɑkɔ yom, ɑ go tirɑ hinkɑntɛ wɔ hɑntum wom sɛ. Tirɑ wɔne kunɑ hɑli wɔ di kunɑ, ɑ gɑ wom fɑhɑm hinno yom tunɑndi ko wom hɔngɑndi."
"knowing this first, that in the last days mockers shall come with mockery, walking after their own lusts,","Wom mɑ hɔngɔ sendi yom kɑ ɑndebi hɑlɑɑlɑ yom jinɑ kɑ cii. Wom mɑ hɔngɔ mo Kpe kɑ ɑ̀ ci Fɑɑbɑkɔ ɑ̀ meire kɑ i yom, ɑ̀ diyɑ yom cii."
"and saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for, from the day that the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.","Wɑ wɔne bei jinɑ kɑ kɔkɔrɔ bɑndɑ hɑnu yom kunɑ, dondɑcɛrɛkpɛ yom kɑɑ kɑɑ kɑ ngei bineibɑɑi yom gɑnɑ."
"For this they wilfully forget, that there were heavens from of old, and an earth compacted out of water and amidst water, by the word of God;","Ǹ kɑɑ cii: Sɑɑ fɔ ɑ̀ kɑɑyom ɑlikɑwɑli tɔ?

"by which means the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished:","Mure kunɑ no, ǹ go dinigɑ kɑ Ikpɛ mee sendi bɔm no bɛɛnɛ goono zɑ dɑm. Yɑ no gɑndɑ mɑ tɛ kɑ hunu hɑri kunɑ kɑ goono hɑri bindi bindi Ikpɛ Sendɑ gɑɑ."
"but the heavens that now are, and the earth, by the same word have been stored up for fire, being reserved against the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.","Yɑ no, hɑndunyɑ kɑ ɑ̀ goono dom, ɑ̀ hɑlɑci sɑɑ kɑ tunfɑnɑ hɑri nɑ ɑ̀ gɔnu."
"But forget not this one thing, beloved, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.",Ammɑ ndɑ sendi fɔlɔnku Ikpɛ nɑ mɑɑsɑ bɛɛnɛ ndɑ mɑɑsɑ gɑndɑ jisi nini sɛ. À go kɑ ǹ jɛ ciiti hɑnu sɛ kɑ ɑ̀ kunɑ ɑ̀ kɑɑ beerem kɑ ǹ si kɑ Ikpɛ gɑnɑ ciiti kɑ ǹ hɑlɑci.
"The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some count slackness; but is longsuffering to you-ward, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.","Ammɑ ɑ binebɑɑkɔ yom, wom mɑ si dinigɑ hɛ fɔlɔnku.

"But the day of the Lord will come as a thief; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall be dissolved with fervent heat, and the earth and the works that are therein shall be burned up.","Kpe si mure pɑi ndɑ ngɑ ɑlikɑwɑli tɔnɑndiyom, zɑngɑ bɔrɔ fɔ yom go kɑ ɑ̀ tɑmmɑ.

"But, according to his promise, we look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.","À himɑ wom mɑ Ikpɛ Hɑnu bɑtu ndɑ bɛɛjɛ kɑ kɑ ɑ̀ sɑsɑ. Hɑnu ngɑ di wɔ ɑ̀ kɑɑyom sɑbu sɛ, bɛɛnɛ kɑɑ dii ndɑ nini kɑ hɑlɑci. Bɛɛnɛ hɛ yom mo kɑɑ mɛnɛ ndɑ dunguɛ."
"Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for these things, give diligence that ye may be found in peace, without spot and blameless in his sight.","Ammɑ Ikpɛ ɑlikɑwɑli bɔm, i go bɛɛnɛ teji yom ndɑ gɑndɑ teji bɑtu, nungu yom kɑ cɛɑndiyom susu goono ndɑ gɔrɛ."
"And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also, according to the wisdom given to him, wrote unto you;","A binebɑɑkɔ yom, zɑ kɑ wom go hɛ nge yom di bɑtu ndɑ bɛɛjɛ wɑ himmɑ dɑm. Kpe mɑ wom gɑru tombi si, tɑɑli si lɑɑkɑli kɑne kunɑ."

"And hereby we know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.","Ngɑ mɑ yɑ ci sɑsɑbɑndiyom hɛ i dulum yom sɛ, ɑ̀ mɑnɑ ci i ŋmɔne yom hinne sɛ bo, ɑmmɑ hɑndunyɑ kulu sɛ mɑ."
"He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him;","De i go kɑ ɑ̀ meire yom gɑnɑ, ɑ̀ gɑɑ no i tɑbɑtɑndi kɑ i nɑ ɑ̀ bei."
"but whoso keepeth his word, in him verily hath the love of God been perfected. Hereby we know that we are in him:","Bɔrɔ kɑ ɑ̀ go cii ngɑ nɑ ɑ̀ bei, ɑmmɑ ɑ̀ si kɑ ɑ̀ meire yom gɑnɑ, tɑngɑrikom no, cimi si ɑkpɛ kunɑ."
he that saith he abideth in him ought himself also to walk even as he walked.,"Ammɑ bɔrɔ kulu kɑ ɑ̀ go kɑ ɑ̀ Sendi gɑnɑ, Ikpɛ bɑɑkɑsine kube ɑkpɛ kunɑ. Wɔne gɑɑ no, i bo bei i goono ɑ̀ kunɑ."
"Beloved, no new commandment write I unto you, but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning: the old commandment is the word which ye heard.","Bɔrɔ kɑ ɑ̀ go cii ngɑ goono Ikpɛ kunɑ ndɑ gɔrɛ, ɑkpɛ mo dirɑ zɑngɑ Yesu Mɛsiyɑ dirɑ."
"Again, a new commandment write I unto you, which thing is true in him and in you; because the darkness is passing away, and the true light already shineth.","A nyɑizei, ɑ̀ mɑnɑ ci meire teji nɑ ɑ go hɑntum wom sɛ, ɑmmɑ meire zeenu no kɑ wom du zɑ sintine.

"He that saith he is in the light and hateth his brother, is in the darkness even until now.","Bine ɑ gɑ meire teji hɑntum wom sɛ, meire kɑ ɑ̀ ci cimi Mɛsiyɑ kunɑ ndɑ wom kunɑ. Kube go bisɑ, cɔfɔ kɑɑri cimi cimi hɑɑgɑ kɔ."
"He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is no occasion of stumbling in him.","Bɔrɔ kɑ ɑ̀ go cii ngɑ goono kɑɑri kunɑ, ɑmmɑ ɑ̀ bine hungu ngɑ nyɑize, kube kunɑ nɑ ɑ̀ goono hɑli mɑɑsɑ."
"But he that hateth his brother is in the darkness, and walketh in the darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because the darkness hath blinded his eyes.","Bɔrɔ kɑ ɑ̀ gɑ bɑɑ ngɑ nyɑize, ɑ̀ goono kɑɑri kunɑ ndɑ gɔrɛ. Hɛ fɔ kulu si ɑ̀ kunɑ kɑ ɑ̀ mɑ nɑm ɑ̀ mɑ hɑitɑ."

"Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world.

These things have I written unto you concerning them that would lead you astray.,"Alikɑwɑli kɑ ngɑ bumbum tɛ i sɛ, ngɑ yɑ ci hundi kɑ ɑ̀ si beeni."

"Behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called children of God; and such we are. For this cause the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not.","De wom go bei ngɑ yɑ cɛsusu no, wom mɑ bei mo bɔrɔ kulu kɑ ɑ̀ go cɛyom susu gbei tɛ, ɑ̀ dɔ no ǹ nɑ ɑkpɛ hɛi."
"Beloved, now are we children of God, and it is not yet made manifest what we shall be.

"My little children, let no man lead you astray: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous:","Bɔrɔ kulu kɑ ɑ̀ goono ɑ̀ kunɑ ndɑ gɔrɛ, ɑ̀ si bo dulum tɛ. Bɔrɔ kulu mo kɑ ɑ̀ bɑ dulum tɛ, ɑkpɛ mɑnɑ di Mɛsiyɑ no, ɑ̀ mɑnɑ ɑ̀ bei mo."
"he that doeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning.

"In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother.","Bɔrɔ kulu kɑ ǹ nɑ ɑ̀ hɛi Ikpɛ dɔ, ɑ̀ si bo dulum tɛ domi Ikpɛ dumɑi goono ɑkpɛ kunɑ ndɑ gɔrɛ.

"For this is the message which ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another:","Wɔne gɑɑ no, ǹ go kɑ Ikpɛ ize yom ndɑ Ibilisi ize yom fɑyɑnkɑ. Bɔrɔ kulu kɑ ɑ̀ si bɑ cɛyom susu gbei tɛ, ɑkpɛ mɑnɑ ci Ikpɛ ŋmɔne. Yɑ nɑ, bɔrɔ kɑ ɑ̀ si bɑɑ ngɑ nyɑize mo."

"We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not abideth in death.","Nyɑizei, wɑ si mɑmɑci de hɑndunyɑ bine go hungu wom."
Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.,"I go bei i bisɑ bu gɑɑ kɑ tɔ hundi dɔ domi i go bɑɑ i nyɑize yom. Bɔrɔ kɑ ɑ̀ sindɑ bɑɑkɑsine ngɑ nyɑize sɛ, ɑkpɛ goono bu kunɑ ndɑ gɔrɛ."
"Hereby know we love, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.","Bɔrɔ kulu kɑ ɑ̀ bine go hungu ngɑ nyɑize, bɔrɔ wikɔ no. Wom go bei kɑ bɔrɔ wikɔ bɑ ɑfɔ sindɑ hundi kɑ ɑ̀ si beeni ngɑ kunɑ ndɑ gɔrɛ."
"But whoso hath the world’s goods, and beholdeth his brother in need, and shutteth up his compassion from him, how doth the love of God abide in him?",Wɔne gɑɑ nɑ i go kɑ Ikpɛ bɑɑkɑsine bei domi Mɛsiyɑ nɑ ngɑ hundi no i sɑbu sɛ. À himɑ i mɑ i hundi yom mɑ no nyɑize yom sɑbu sɛ.

"and whatsoever we ask we receive of him, because we keep his commandments and do the things that are pleasing in his sight.","A binebɑɑkɔ yom, de i bine si kɑ i ciiti kɑ zeeri kulu i yɑru Ikpɛ jine."
"And this is his commandment, that we should believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, even as he gave us commandment.","Hɛ kulu kɑ i go ŋmɑɑrɛ i go du ɑ̀ Ikpɛ dɔ, zɑmɑ i go kɑ ɑ̀ meire yom gɑnɑ. I go tɛ mo hɛ yom kulu kɑ ɑ̀ kɑɑni ɑ̀ sɛ."
